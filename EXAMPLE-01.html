<h1>Example #1</h1>

<p class="subtitle">Big Integers</p>

<p>The time has come to give you an extended example. This will, hopefully, give you a better idea
  of how some of the features I've been talking about in the lessons work in a real program. The
  short examples in my lessons are fine, but they don't give you the big picture.</p>

<p>In this example, I want to develop a useful numeric class. In particular, I will create a class
  <span class="code">big_int</span>. Objects of this class will act just like normal integers, but
  they will have a much greater capacity. In particular, they will support integers with up to 256
  decimal digits. Although it is rare to need such large integers, there are applications for
  which they are essential. By creating an appropriate class, with a complete set of overloaded
  operators, using such integers can be made very natural.</p>

<p>An even more useful version of <span class="code">big_int</span> would allow the number of
  digits to grow dynamically to whatever was necessary. Creating such a class is more complicated
  and requires techniques that we haven't covered yet. For now my arbitrary limit of 256 decimal
  digits should be sufficient.</p>

<p>As is typical, class <span class="code">big_int</span> comes in two files. The first,
  big_int.hpp, contains the class definition. The various supporting functions will all be in
  big_int.cpp. Any program that wishes to use <span class="code">big_int</span> objects will need
  to #include "big_int.hpp" and also compile big_int.cpp into the program.</p>

<h3>What operations should big_int support?</h3>

<p>When designing an abstract type this is the central question. My goal is to have <span
    class="code">big_int</span> behave like a normal integer. This means</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>It should have some constructors to allow it to be initialized.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>It should support "all the usual" math operations.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>It should support relational tests.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>It should support I/O operations.</p>
  </li>

</ol>

<p>I can capture these requirements in the following declarations</p>

<pre class="code">
namespace vtc {

  class big_int {
    friend std::ostream &amp;operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream &amp;, const big_int &amp;);
    friend std::istream &amp;operator&gt;&gt;(std::istream &amp;, big_int &amp;);
      // I/O operations.

    friend bool operator==(const big_int &amp;, const big_int &amp;);
    friend bool operator&lt; (const big_int &amp;, const big_int &amp;);
      // Relational operators.

    public:
      big_int();
        // Default constructor.

      big_int(long number);
        // Allows a big_int to be initialized with a normal int.

      void operator+=(const big_int &amp;);
      void operator-=(const big_int &amp;);
      void operator*=(const big_int &amp;);
      void operator/=(const big_int &amp;);
      void operator%=(const big_int &amp;);
        // All the usual math operations.

    private:
      // To be determined.
  };

}
</pre>

<p>This class definition provides for two constructors, the two basic I/O functions, two
  relational operators, and the "in place" math operators. The in place math operators are member
  functions and would be used like this</p>

<pre class="code">
int main()
{
  big_int X, Y;

  X += Y;  // Really X.operator+=(Y);

  // etc...
}
</pre>

<p>The in place operators are actually more basic than the usual binary operators. It is very easy
  to implement the binary operators in terms of the in place operators. Thus the header file needs
  to also include the following inline functions</p>

<pre class="code">
namespace vtc {

  inline big_int operator+(const big_int &amp;left, const big_int &amp;right)
    { big_int temp(left); temp += right; return temp; }

  inline big_int operator-(const big_int &amp;left, const big_int &amp;right)
    { big_int temp(left); temp -= right; return temp; }

  inline big_int operator*(const big_int &amp;left, const big_int &amp;right)
    { big_int temp(left); temp *= right; return temp; }

  inline big_int operator/(const big_int &amp;left, const big_int &amp;right)
    { big_int temp(left); temp /= right; return temp; }

  inline big_int operator%(const big_int &amp;left, const big_int &amp;right)
    { big_int temp(left); temp %= right; return temp; }

}
</pre>

<p>Each of these functions creates a local <span class="code">big_int</span> named <span
    class="code">temp</span> and initializes it (using the new-style syntax) to be a copy of <span
    class="code">left</span>. It then uses the in place operator defined in the class to do the
  computation and leave the result in <span class="code">temp</span>. Finally it returns <span
      class="code">temp</span>. That's all there is to these functions.</p>

<p>Similarly of the six relational operators, you only need to define two. The other four are
  easily expressed in terms of the first two.</p>

<pre class="code">
namespace vtc {

  inline bool operator!=(const big_int &amp;left, const big_int &amp;right)
    { return !(left == right); }

  inline bool operator&gt;=(const big_int &amp;left, const big_int &amp;right)
    { return !(left &lt; right); }

  inline bool operator&gt;(const big_int &amp;left, const big_int &amp;right)
    { return right &lt; left; }

  inline bool operator&lt;=(const big_int &amp;left, const big_int &amp;right)
    { return right &gt;= left; }

}
</pre>

<p>Supporting "all the usual" math and relational operations is not as difficult as it seems! I
  should point out, however, that in some cases you might want to write out all of these functions
  individually. Defining one function in terms of others does not always lead to an acceptably
  efficient implementation. However, if your primary interest is to get the class up and running
  you can often leave issues of efficiency for a later revision.</p>

<p>Now that I have defined which operations I want to support, I need to think about how to
  represent <span class="code">big_ints</span>. I need to think about the private section of the
  class.</p>

<p>There are numerous possibilities, but for now I will go with something quite simple. I will use
  an array of short integers to represent the digits. Each element of the array will be a number
  from 0 to 9 and there will be 256 elements in the array. I will use the zeroth array element as
  the least significant digit. Since each array element only needs to hold a number from 0 to 9, I
  decided to use short integer array elements to save memory. This is an application where using
  characters to hold numbers would be sensible, but using characters that way is unusual and I
  felt it might make my example confusing.</p>

<p>Since I want <span class="code">big_int</span>s to handle both positive and negative numbers, I
  will create a flag member that holds the sign information only. The digits in the array will
  always be positive.</p>

<p>This representation means that every <span class="code">big_int</span> object will take about
  260 bytes of memory. That's a fair amount. In general I hope to avoid copying <span
      class="code">big_int</span> objects whenever I can. This is one major reason for using
  reference parameters on all the functions.</p>

<p>The attached header file, big_int.hpp, embodies these declarations. There are a few other minor
  issues discussed in that file, please take a quick look at it. These operations should allow me
  to declare <span class="code">big_int</span> objects, initialize them with numbers, and compute
  with them normally. In addition, I can do I/O with <span class="code"
  >big_ints</span> in the same way as I can use for regular integers.</p>

<p>The implementation file is where I will put the definitions of all the (non-inline) functions.
  When I have completed writing (and testing) all of these functions, my job will be done and
  <span class="code">big_int</span> will be ready to deploy.</p>

<p>I will start with the default constructor. Let it set the <span class="code"
>big_int</span> it is constructing to zero.</p>

<pre class="code">
namespace vtc {

  big_int::big_int()
  {
    sign = 1;  // Zero is positive.

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 256; i++) {
      digits[i] = 0;
    }
  }

}
</pre>

<p>The constructor function needs to initialize the members. Here I set the sign flag to one to
  indicate a positive number and zero out all of the digits. Notice that this implementation
  allows for the possibility of both a positive and negative zero. Mathematically, +0 == -0. It
  would be necessary to consider this possibility in the comparison functions for <span
      class="code">big_int</span>. However, instead of doing that I will simple make sure that -0
  is never created. This tends to be a more satisfactory solution in the long run.</p>

<p>In the function above I use</p>

<pre class="code">
for (int i = 0; ...
</pre>

<p>to declare and initialize the loop index right inside the loop. This is legal in C++ (also in
  C99). The scope of the loop index created this way is confined to the loop body. The object
  <span class="code">i</span> is undeclared below the loop.</p>

<p>The other constructor is a bit harder. It is supposed to initialize a <span class="code"
>big_int</span> with a normal number. Yet my representation of <span class="code"
>big_int</span>s is quite different than the way normal numbers are stored. I'll have to break the
  normal number into individual digits.</p>

<pre class="code">
namespace vtc {

  big_int::big_int(long number)
  {
    int i;

    // Set the sign flag appropriately. Make sure number is positive.
    sign = 1;
    if (number &lt; 0) {
      sign = -1;
      number = -number;
    }

    // Zero out ALL the digits to start. When the constructor begins
    // executing the data members have indeterminate values.
    //
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 256; i++) {
      digits[i] = 0;
    }

    // Now get the individual digits of number, one at a time.
    i = 0;
    while (number != 0) {
      digits[i] = static_cast&lt;short&gt;(number % 10);
      i++;
      number /= 10;
    }
  }

}
</pre>

<p>In this function I use</p>

<pre class="code">
static_cast&lt;short&gt;(number % 10)
</pre>

<p>to convert the result of <span class="code">number % 10</span> into a short integer. This
  conversion is definitely safe since the result will definitely fit into a short, but I don't
  want the compiler warning me about my trying to put a long into a short. You might be familiar
  with the C style cast</p>

<pre class="code">
(short)(number % 10);
</pre>

<p>This works in C++ as well, but it is considered old fashion. On the rare occasions when you
  need to do a type conversion you should use the newer style.</p>

<p>Next I will implement the addition operation. This operation has to work on two <span
    class="code">big_int</span> objects: the first is implicit and the second is explicit. Since
  this is a method it has direct access to the object against which is is invoked (the left
  operand of the operator). It can access the members of the object provided as a parameter using
  the dot operator in the usual way.</p>

<pre class="code">
namespace vtc {

  void big_int::operator+=(const big_int &amp;right)
  {
    // If both operands are positive or if both are negative, we
    // just add their absolute values and leave the sign alone.
    // Notice below how I access the left operand's members directly
    // and the right operands members using the dot operator.
    //
    if (sign == right.sign) {
      short sum, carry = 0;
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; 256; i++) {
        sum       = digits[i] + right.digits[i] + carry;
        digits[i] = sum % 10;
        carry     = sum / 10;
      }
      // No overflow checking!
    }

    // The signs are different. In that case I really need to subtract.
    else {
      std::cerr &lt;&lt; "big_int::operator+=(): "
        "Addition of unlike signs not yet implemented!\n";
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<p>To keep this example short, I'm not going to bother implementing every detail of <span
    class="code">big_int</span> here. The case where the two numbers being added have different
  signs is harder because I first need to figure out which has a larger absolute magnitude and
  keep track of the resulting sign flag appropriately. It is my intention for this class to
  properly handle negatives in every way, but for now I just put in an error message that will
  trigger if anyone attempts to use the unimplemented facilities. The C++ feature of
  <i>exceptions</i> is a better way to report an error like this. I will cover exceptions in a
  later lesson.</p>

<p>The subtraction, multiplication, and division operators must also be written but again, in the
  interests of keeping this example short, I will skip those for now. I leave the implementation
  of those operations as an exercise for the reader.</p>

<p>Let me now turn my attention to the relational operators.</p>

<pre class="code">
namespace vtc {

  bool operator==(const big_int &amp;left, const big_int &amp;right)
  {
    // To be equal, they must have the same sign. No -0 allowed.
    if (left.sign != right.sign) return false;

    // They must also have all identical digits.
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 256; i++) {
      if (left.digits[i] != right.digits[i]) return false;
    }

    // If I get here, they must be equal.
    return true;
  }

}
</pre>

<p>Since this function is not a method, I don't have implicit access to either operand. I thus
  have to use the dot operator on both the left and right operands. However, because this function
  is a friend of <span class="code">big_int</span> I do have the ability to access the private
  section of the operands without a problem.</p>

<p>This function also uses the C++ type <span class="code">bool</span> to handle true/false
  values. In C, one just uses int for this purpose, but C++ has a real, built-in type you can (and
  should) use instead. The keywords <span class="code">true</span> and <span
      class="code">false</span> are the only values you can legitimately put into a bool object.
</p>

<p>The operator&lt; function is a little trickier, particular when it comes to dealing with
  negative values properly.</p>

<pre class="code">
namespace vtc {

  bool operator&lt;(const big_int &amp;left, const big_int &amp;right)
  {
    if (left.sign &lt; right.sign) return true;
    if (left.sign &gt; right.sign) return false;
      // Here I use the fact that -1 &lt; 1 to check for situations where
      // the two numbers have a different sign. After getting through
      // this the two numbers must have the same sign.

    if (left.sign == 1) {
      // The two numbers are both positive.
      for (int i = 255; i &gt;=0; i--) {
        if (left.digits[i] &lt; right.digits[i]) return true;
        if (left.digits[i] &gt; right.digits[i]) return false;
        // Otherwise these two digits are equal. Let's try the next pair.
      }
    }
    else {
      // The two numbers are both negative.
      for (int i = 255; i &gt;=0; i--) {
        if (left.digits[i] &lt; right.digits[i]) return false;
        if (left.digits[i] &gt; right.digits[i]) return true;
        // Otherwise these two digits are equal. Let's try the next pair.
      }
    }

    // If I get here the two numbers must have had all equal digits.
    return false;
  }

}
</pre>

<p>Okay, now what about those I/O functions? The inserter is not too difficult.</p>

<pre class="code">
namespace vtc {

  std::ostream &amp;operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream &amp;os, const big_int &amp;right)
  {
    int i;

    if (right.sign == -1) os &lt;&lt; "-";
      // Print a minus sign if the number is negative.

    // Find the first non-zero digit.
    for (i = 255; i &gt;= 0; i--) {
      if (right.digits[i] != 0) break;
    }

    // If the above loop didn't break, then there were no non-zero
    // digits. Thus the number is 0.
    //
    if (i == -1) os &lt;&lt; "0";
    else {
      // Print the number, one digit at a time.
      while (i &gt;= 0) {
        os &lt;&lt; right.digits[i];
        i--;
      }
    }
  }

}
</pre>

<p>This function avoids printing out leading zeros (a good thing since there might be a couple of
  hundred of them) and handles negative numbers properly. It does not mimic the formatting
  features of the built-in types. For example if the caller uses the <span
      class="code">setw</span> manipulator to set a field width before trying to print a <span
      class="code">big_int</span>, it won't work as expected. This can be corrected, but doing so
  is beyond the scope of this example.</p>

<p>The extractor function is tricky. It needs to read the input a character at a time. If it tries
  to read an integer with the standard extractor, it would overflow when trying to read a very big
  integer. Again, in the interest of keeping my example short, I won't bother implementing that
  function here.</p>

<p>See big_int.cpp for the overall results so far. I invite you to enhance and extend this class.
  Fill in the other functions so that it is more generally useful!</p>

<p>
  <i>Note: to properly complete this example, I need to also talk about testing the <span
      class="code">big_int</span> class</i>
