<h1>Example #2</h1>

<p class="subtitle">Text Quotation: Using std::string</p>

<p>In this example, I will develop a somewhat useful utility for processing a text file. Instead
  of handling the text with C-style arrays of characters, I will use <span
      class="code">std::string</span>. The intent of this example is to show you how <span
      class="code">std::strings</span> might be used in action. Actually, there are techniques for
  handling <span class="code">std::string</span> that I can't illustrate here because they involve
  aspects of C++ we have not yet discussed. However, this example should still serve as a useful
  guide to how strings might be used in real life.</p>

<p>Here is the problem I wish to solve: Suppose you had a plain text file, and wanted to reformat
  it so that it was quoted in the manner that is typical for mail messages. That is, each line
  should be prefixed by the string "> " like so:</p>

<pre class="terminal">
This is a line of text.
</pre>

<p>becomes:</p>

<pre class="terminal">
> This is a line of text.
</pre>

<p>To make the program more interesting (and more useful), it should also deal with word wrapping.
  This is important because the extra two characters added to each line will, in general, cause
  some lines to extend too far to the right. In any case, many text files have excessively long
  lines anyway, so it would be helpful if the program wrapped lines.</p>

<p>The program will distinguish one paragraph from the next by one (or more) blank lines between
  them. Within each paragraph it will attempt to fill each line as much as possible (with the
  added "> " at the start of each line), wrapping to the next line after the previous one is
  filled. The following shows the effect I'm talking about. For purposes of illustration, I'll use
  a narrow line length.</p>

<pre class="terminal">
This is my first line of text.
This is short.
This is a rather long line of text. It is so long that it should
have been wrapped in the first place.

This is the next paragraph. Here I blather on and on.
Still more.
</pre>

<p>The program should transform the text above into:</p>

<pre class="terminal">
> This is my first line of text. This is short.
> This is a rather long line of text. It is so
> long that it should have been wrapped in the
> first place.
>
> This is the next paragraph. Here I blather on
> and on. Still more.
</pre>

<p>For the sake of standard 80 column terminals, the real program will consider a line "too long"
  if it is longer than 76 characters. This will fill the width of the screen and minimize the
  apparent degree of raggedness. on the right-hand side.</p>

<p>The program that I'm going to write here will not be very smart. It won't handle preformatted
  text, and it will believe that there should be exactly one space between every word. This will
  limit its usefulness considerably. I invite you to enhance the program to make it better!</p>

<p>The first step in creating a program is to understand exactly what must be done. Hopefully, my
  informal description above suffices to explain that in this case. The next step is to design the
  program's logic and data. I use a pseudo language to design my programs. It is easier to work
  with than C++ itself because it resembles normal English, yet it is still fairly easy to
  translate into a working program. Those of you who have had me as an instructor before will
  recognize my pseudo language. Yet even if you have never seen it before, you should have enough
  programming experience to be able to understand what I'm getting at. The point here is to make
  the logic of the program clear. The precise details of the language I use are not important.</p>

<p>The program should read the input file a line at a time until there is no more input to
  read.</p>

<pre class="pcode">
WHILE &lt;Getting the next line from the input file works> LOOP
  &lt;Process that line>
END
</pre>

<p>Naturally, we have to open the input and output files first. What should their names be? I
  think we should take the name of the input file from the command line (much more useful than
  having it fixed in the program) and make the output file have the same name as the input except
  with a ".q" at the end (the 'q' is for "quoted"). This decision should really be part of the
  specification above. However, when creating a program informally, one often finds it necessary
  to fill in some details of the specification as one goes along. In a serious effort, the
  specification would be a formal document and would have already spelled out these points.</p>

<p>In any case, the enhanced pseudocode now looks like</p>

<pre class="pcode">
&lt;Get the name of the input file>
&lt;Get the name of the output file (same as input with ".q" appended)>
IF &lt;The input file could not be opened> THEN
  &lt;Display an error message>
  &lt;Exit>
END
IF &lt;The output file could not be opened> THEN
  &lt;Display and error message>
  &lt;Exit>
END

WHILE &lt;Getting the next line from the input file works> LOOP
  &lt;Process that line>
END
</pre>

<p>Notice in my pseudocode above I don't worry about closing the files. I know that I'm going to
  be using the C++ iostream library to implement this, and I know that iostreams will close files
  automatically. In theory, pseudocode is independent of the language you use to finally write the
  program. In practice, it's never really 100% like that.</p>

<p>Now the hard part: how should I process each line of input? I think the proper approach is to
  maintain an output line that is in the process of being filled. Each time a paragraph break
  occurs, the output line needs to be "flushed" even if it's not filled completely. Otherwise,
  each word on the input line needs to be added to the output line (flushing the output line when
  necessary). Hmmm. Let's see.</p>

<pre class="pcode">
WHILE &lt;Getting the next line from the input file works> LOOP
  IF &lt;The line is blank> THEN
    &lt;Write the current, partially filled output line>
    &lt;Write a "blank" output line (it would have just a "> ")>
    &lt;Prepare a new output line by putting a "> " at the start>
  ELSE
    FOR &lt;Each word of the input line> LOOP
      &lt;Append that word onto the end of the output line>
      IF &lt;The output line is too long> THEN
        &lt;Write the output line>
        &lt;Prepare a new output line>
      END
    END
  END
END
</pre>

<p>Okay... this logic looks promising, but it has some problems. First, it writes output lines
  that are always too long since if fills lines until they become oversized. Instead, I should
  check the sizes before I do the appending and perhaps write the current output line first. This
  is trickier to do than it sounds, however, because in the perverse case where a line contains a
  single word that is longer than the allowed line length, I don't want to go into an infinite
  loop. Let me modify the inner FOR loop.</p>

<pre class="pcode">
FOR &lt;Each word of the input line> LOOP
  IF &lt;Appending this word would make the output too long> THEN
    &lt;Write the output line>
    &lt;Prepare a new output line>
  END
  &lt;Append that word onto the end of the output line>
END
</pre>

<p>Let me check this in the case of a very long word. When that word is encountered, it will cause
  the output line to be written (even if it is not very far filled at that time). This is fine.
  Then that word WILL be appended onto the next output line. Since the append operation is not in
  an ELSE clause, the very long word is guaranteed to be output and the next word will be
  processed. This is good. There will be no infinite loop. The long word will mess up the output,
  but that's okay. It isn't every day when you find words 76+ characters long.</p>

<p>The second problem with the original logic above is that it prints out extra blank lines
  between paragraphs if there is more than one blank line between the paragraphs originally. Let's
  take a closer look at that logic.</p>

<pre class="pcode">
IF &lt;The line is blank> THEN
  &lt;Write the current, partially filled output line>
  &lt;Write a "blank" output line (it would have just a "> ")>
  &lt;Prepare a new output line by putting a "> " at the start>
ELSE
  ...
</pre>

<p>If I am processing a paragraph and then come to a blank line that marks the end. I have to
  output my partially filled line and then that same blank like as well. However, if the next
  input line is also blank, I will output end up outputting two blank likes. The partially filled
  line in that case will just consist of "> " and then there is the explicit blank line as
  well.</p>

<p>The problem is that I need to do something special on the first blank line after a paragraph,
  but not on every blank line after a paragraph. Thus, I have to keep track of when I'm in a
  paragraph and when I'm not. This will require a flag. To generate this logic, I will cut and
  past my original p-code and edit it. I get the following result:</p>

<pre class="pcode">
&lt;Prepare an initial output line>
&lt;Set the in-paragraph flag to FALSE>
WHILE &lt;Getting the next line from the input file works> LOOP
  IF &lt;The line is blank> THEN
    IF &lt;in-paragraph AND the output line has something on it> THEN
      &lt;Write the current, partially filled output line>
      &lt;Prepare a new output line by putting a "> " at the start>
      &lt;Set the in-paragraph flag to FALSE>
    END
    &lt;Write a "blank" output line (it would have just a "> ")>
  ELSE
    &lt;Set the in-paragraph flag to TRUE>
    FOR &lt;Each word of the input line> LOOP
      IF &lt;Appending this word would make the output too long> THEN
        &lt;Write the output line>
        &lt;Prepare a new output line>
      END
      &lt;Append that word onto the end of the output line>
    END
  END
END
</pre>

<p>Okay. I believe this p-code performs the desired function. I could be wrong, however, because I
  make mistakes. If I notice a problem during the implementation or testing phases, I will fix it
  then. In any case, the complete p-code of this program is in the attached file quote.pcd. I
  added some comments to that file. The act of writing the comments helped me to further check my
  work by forcing me to go over the logic one more time.</p>

<p>Aha! In fact, while preparing the comments in that file, I noticed that I don't really need the
  in-paragraph flag at all. I can use the fact that there is a text in the output line to signal
  if it should be output. That is much cleaner and nicer. The p-code in quote.pcd reflects this
  enhancement.</p>

<p>Okay. Now I'm ready to actually write the program. As I look over the p-code, I can see that
  most operations that are called for are straightforward. There are two exceptions. In one place,
  I need to know if a line is blank. In another place, I need to break individual words off of a
  line. I will write two separate functions for those operations. The first is not too bad.</p>

<pre class="code">
//
// This function returns true of the given line contains only white
// space. If there is a "word" on that line, it will return false.
//
bool is_blank( const string &amp;line )
{
    // Empty lines are blank.
    if( line.length( ) == 0 ) return true;

    // Lines containing only spaces, tabs, formfeeds, carriage returns,
    // and new lines are also blank. Here I see if there is even one
    // character in the line that is not one of those that I mentioned.
    //
    if( line.find_first_not_of( " \t\f\r\n", 0 ) == string::npos )
        return true;

    return false;
}
</pre>

<p>Actually, the second test should also cover the first case. However, the first test is very
  fast and probably often true, so it might be better to leave it there anyway. I don't expect to
  see any '\n' characters in these lines because when I read them from the file, the function I
  use will strip them out. However, I'll include it in the check above just to make the function a
  bit more general.</p>

<p>The other function is trickier.</p>

<pre class="code">
//
// This function takes the next white space delimited word out of line.
// It modifies line to delete the word and returns the word in "word".
// It returns true if it found a word and false otherwise.
//
bool get_next_word( string &amp;line, string &amp;word )
{
    // Find the first non white space character.
    int non_white = line.find_first_not_of( " \t\f\r\n", 0 );

    // If there wasn't any, we have no word.
    if( non_white == string::npos ) return false;

    // Otherwise locate the next white space. It is possible that this
    // will return string::npos if this is the last word on the line.
    // That shouldn't cause a problem with what follows since excessive
    // values will be taken as "all" in these contexts. (The npos value
    // is the highest possible string index).
    //
    int white = line.find_first_of( " \t\f\r\n", non_white + 1 );

    word = line.substr( non_white, white - non_white );
    line.erase( 0, white );
    return true;
}
</pre>

<p>The rest of the program is straightforward. See quote.cpp for the final version.</p>

<p>NOTE! During testing of the program developed above, I found a bug. In particular, if there is
  a partially filled line after the last input line is processed (and this would often happen), it
  is never outputted. I corrected this by putting some additional code just after the main while
  loop. The final version that is attached should be correct (as far as I know).</p>
