<h3>"Hello, World!" in C++</h3>

<p>To start things off, I will show you a program that prints "Hello, World!" on the terminal
  using C++. Although this program is very simple, it is always a good idea, when working with a
  new language or environment, to write this simple program first. There is no sense trying to
  write anything more complicated until you can get something very simple working.</p>

<p>Since C++ is a superset of C (approximately), the basic "Hello, World!" program in C will work.
  However, C++ comes with an entirely different library of I/O functions that you should get used
  to using. This library is called IOStreams. Here is the "Hello, World!" program in C++ using the
  IOStreams library:</p>

<pre class="code">
  #include &lt;iostream&gt;

  int main( )
  {
      std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, World!\n";
      return 0;
  }
</pre>

<p>Let me point out a few things about this program.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>To declare the facilities in the IOStreams library you need to #include the header
    &lt;iostream&gt;. Notice that there is no .h at the end of that header's name. This is normal.
    The C++ standard library is declared in header files that do not have any extension. Note,
    however, that is common for programmers to use .h or .hpp extensions on the header files they
    create.</p></li>

  <li><p>Unlike in C, you do not need to declare main as taking a void parameter. The empty
    parentheses indicates that there are no parameters. C++ compilers will accept void in the
    parameter list, but it is not necessary and commonly left out.</p></li>

  <li><p>The actual I/O operations are all done on the object named <span
      class="code">cout</span>. The <span class="code">cout</span> object represents the standard
    output device---the screen of your console. You can write characters to that device using the
    <span class="code">&lt;&lt;</span> operator. The characters get written out one after another
    in a sequential stream, and the <span class="code">&lt;&lt;</span> operator really just
    inserts characters into that stream. For this reason it is often called an inserter.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now I want to say a few words about namespaces.</p>

<p>C++ is designed for very large programs. One of the problems very large programs have is
  coordinating names. In C, every function in a program must have a unique name. In a large
  program there might be thousands of functions written by people who don't know each other (for
  example in competing libraries). If any two of those functions have the same name there are
  problems.</p>

<p>To avoid naming problems, C++ allows you to put functions and anything else with a name into a
  "namespace". Each namespace might contain hundreds of names, but since a single library supplier
  controls the entire name space associated with that library, that supplier can ensure that no
  two names in it collide.</p>

<p>An application might use several different namespaces. If two functions in different namespaces
  happen to have the same name, it is not an error because the functions can be distinguished by
  which namespace they are from. This is exactly the same reason why operating systems allow users
  to create directories. Two files with the same name can exist on the disk provided they are in
  different directories.</p>

<p>It happens that the entire standard C++ library is in a namespace called <span
    class="code">std</span>. Thus whenever I wish to use a name from the library I must prefix
  that name with a suitable namespace qualifier. That's why I have <span class="code"
  >std::</span> in front of <span class="code">cout</span> in my sample program above. That tells
  the compiler (and the programmer) that I'm interested in the <span class="code"
  >cout</span> name in the <span class="code">std</span> namespace.</p>

<p>It might seem like an annoyance to prefix names from the standard library with <span
    class="code">std::</span>. In fact, at times it is. However, for reasons that will become
  clear later, you don't need to use namespace qualifiers as much as you might think. If you find
  yourself accessing names in a particular namespace frequently you can include a <i>using
    directive</i> at the top of your source file. For example</p>

<pre class="code">
  #include &lt;iostream&gt;

  using namespace std;

  int main( )
  {
      cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, World!\n";
      return 0;
  }
</pre>

<p>In this version I tell the compiler that it should treat all names in namespace <span
    class="code">std</span> as if they had been declared in the <i>global namespace</i>. Such
  names can then be accessed without the <span class="code">std::</span> qualifier. Note that the
  using directive should come after the #include &lt;iostream&gt;. If you put it before the
  #include the compiler will not know about the name <span class="code">std</span> when it sees
  the using directive and it will produce an error message.</p>

<p>In some older texts you might see the "Hello, World" program like this:</p>

<pre class="code">
  #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

  int main( )
  {
      cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, World!\n";
      return 0;
  }
</pre>

<p>This version #includes &lt;iostream.h&gt; instead of &lt;iostream&gt; and does not bother with
  the namespace stuff at all. This may work, particularly if you are using an old compiler.
  Namespaces were added to C++ relatively recently. Old compilers do not support them. To maintain
  compatibility with old programs, modern C++ compilers often distinguish between headers like
  &lt;iostream&gt; and &lt;iostream.h&gt;. The header with the .h declares things in the global
  namespace as it was done in the days before namespaces. The header without the .h declares
  things in namespace <span class="code">std</span>. In this tutorial I will follow the official
  C++ standard and use namespace std as appropriate. You should do the same in your own programs
  unless you have some specific reason to do otherwise.</p>

<h3>Compiling C++ programs</h3>

<p>To compile the basic "Hello, World!" program, you must first put the program into a file. While
  C programs always end with a .c extension, the convention for C++ programs is less well defined.
  Different systems tend to use different extensions, although the most common extensions are
  .cpp, .cc, .cxx, and .C (note the uppercase letter). In the Windows world, the .cpp extension is
  pretty universal. That is also fine to use on many Unix systems so that is what I will use in
  this tutorial. Use your favorite text editor to create the file <span
      class="terminal">hello.cpp</span> and type in the basic "Hello, World!" program I showed
  above.</p>

<p>To compile it on a Unix system using gcc do something like:</p>

<pre class="terminal">
  $ g++ -o hello hello.cpp
</pre>

<p>The C++ compiler in the GNU Compiler Collection is called <span
    class="terminal">g++</span>. The <span class="terminal">-o hello</span> tells the compiler to
  put the executable output into the file named <span class="terminal">hello</span>. After the
  compiler finishes do:</p>

<pre class="terminal">
  $ hello
</pre>

<p>to run the program. It should print "Hello, World!" on the terminal. Congratulations, you have
  written a C++ program!</p>

<h3>References</h3>

<p>There are two C++ features that I want to introduce right away. We will use them quite a bit.
  The first feature is <i>references</i>.</p>

<p>A reference is really just another name for something else. It is like an alias. Here is a
  simple example.</p>

<pre class="code">
  //
  // The following function illustrates a simple way to use a reference.
  //
  void example( )
  {
      int  number;        // Your typical integer.
      int &amp;ref = number;  // This declares ref to be of type "reference to int"
                          //   and "binds" it to the variable number.

      number = 1;    // Puts 1 into number.
      ref    = 2;    // Puts 2 into number!
  }
</pre>

<p>The expression <span class="code">ref = 2</span> puts 2 into the variable <span
    class="code">number</span> because <span class="code">ref</span> "refers" to <span
    class="code">number</span>. The reference <span class="code">ref</span> is like an alternate
  name for <span class="code">number</span>. Anything that you do to <span
      class="code">ref</span>, you are really doing to <span class="code">number</span>. In my
  example above there is really only one variable: <span class="code">number</span>. The reference
  does not actually exist as an entity in memory. It is just a label for something that does
  exist.</p>

<p>When you declare a reference like I did above you must "bind" it to a real variable. You must
  tell the compiler to which variable the reference refers. It is an error to declare a reference
  and not attach it to a variable. Null references do not exist.</p>

<p>My example above is not very interesting. References are hardly ever used this way. In real
  life, references are mostly used as function parameters. Consider this example</p>

<pre class="code">
  //
  // This function has reference parameters. This is very common.
  //
  void swap( int &amp;A, int &amp;B )
  {
      int temp = A;   // Save a copy of A aside for later.

      A = B;          // Put B into A.
      B = temp;       // Put the old A into B.
  }
</pre>

<p>This function might be used like this</p>

<pre class="code">
  int main( )
  {
      int X, Y;

      // ... Put values into X and Y.

      swap( X, Y );
      return 0;
  }
</pre>

<p>When <span class="code">swap</span> is called, the parameters <span class="code">A</span> and
  <span class="code">B</span> are bound to the real variables <span class="code">X</span> and
  <span class="code">Y</span>. Inside the function <span class="code">A</span> refers to the
  caller's <span class="code">X</span> and <span class="code">B</span> refers to the caller's
  <span class="code">Y</span>. The <span class="code">swap</span> function exchanges the values
  stored in <span class="code">X</span> and <span class="code">Y</span> (via the references) as
  desired and then returns.</p>

<p>To understand the significance of this, look at this version of swap</p>

<pre class="code">
  //
  // This function takes integer parameters
  //
  void swap( int A, int B )
  {
      // Same as before
      int temp = A;

      A = B;
      B = temp;
  }
</pre>

<p>This does not work as expected. When the caller does <span class="code">swap(X,
    Y)</span>, the values of arguments <span class="code">X</span> and <span class="code"
>Y</span> are <em>copied</em> into the parameters <span class="code">A</span> and <span
    class="code">B</span>. The function exchanges the copies, but does absolutely nothing with the
  original variables. C++, like C, passes arguments to functions "by value." This means the
  arguments are copied into the function parameters when the function is called.</p>

<p>However, reference parameters work differently. When a function with a reference parameter is
  called, the reference is bound to the argument and no copy of anything is made. Inside the
  function the reference refers back to the variable that was used by the caller. This facility is
  often called "pass by reference". In some languages it is the only way parameters are
  passed.</p>

<p>You can get a similar effect in plain C using pointers like this:</p>

<pre class="code">
  //
  // This function takes pointer parameters
  //
  void swap( int *A, int *B )
  {
      // Same idea as before.
      int temp = *A;

      *A = *B;
      *B = temp;
  }
</pre>

<p>In this example <span class="code">A</span>, and <span class="code">B</span>, are pointers to
  integers that exist elsewhere. Inside the function I have to use the indirection operator (the
  <span class="code">*</span>) to get at the integers pointed at by those pointers. Notice that
  <span class="code">temp</span> must still be an integer (not a pointer) since it has to hold a
  temporary integer value. I am not trying to swap pointers after all! (If that does not make
  sense to you, reread the above paragraph and think about it awhile until it does).</p>

<p>With my pointer oriented swap function I have to call it like this:</p>

<pre class="code">
  int main( )
  {
      int X, Y;

      // Put values into X and Y.

      swap( &amp;X, &amp;Y );
      return 0;
  }
</pre>

<p>This works, but it is annoying to have to put those ampersands ("address of") in there. With
  references the call is more natural. You will see later that reference parameters are very
  important in C++. There are certain areas where you must use them to get the effects you
  want.</p>

<p>It is also possible in C++ to return references from functions. This is handy at times too. We
  will talk more about how that works in a later lesson.</p>

<h3>const</h3>

<p>The second C++ feature I'd like to introduce now is C++'s handling of const, particularly how
  it interacts with references.</p>

<p>Both C and C++ allow you to declare constants by putting the word <span class="code"
>const</span> in front of the declaration.</p>

<pre class="code">
  const int MAX = 100;
</pre>

<p>When you declare a constant you must initialize it. This is because you can't modify the value
  of a constant after you declare it so if you didn't initialize it there would be no way to give
  it a value.</p>

<pre class="code">
  const int MAX;
  MAX = 100;      // Error. Can't modify a constant.
</pre>

<p>In my example above I used all uppercase letters for the name of my constant. That is common,
  but not universal.</p>

<p>In many courses people speak of "variables". However, that word is imprecise. Not all so-called
  variables can vary. In my example above would you call <span
      class="code">MAX</span> a constant variable? That really doesn't make any sense.</p>

<p>A more accurate term is "object". In my example above, <span class="code">MAX</span> is a
  constant integer object. Using the word object may sound awkward and overly formal, but it
  really is better. In this course I will use "object" from now on to talk about objects. I will
  drop the word variable. The important thing for you to remember is that objects are things that
  occupy memory and that can hold values. Every object in a C++ program has a type and you have to
  specify that type when you create the object.</p>

<p>References are not objects, by the way, because they don't generally occupy any memory and they
  don't have values. The object a reference refers to has a value, but the reference itself does
  not. This distinction between references and objects is a subtle one but it is a distinction
  that will prove important in your later study.</p>

<p>Okay... declaring constant objects is neat, but the real beauty of const is as it applies to
  pointer and reference parameters. I'll leave pointers alone for the moment (but they are handled
  in an analogous manner) and just talk about references. Consider this example:</p>

<pre class="code">
  //
  // This function annoys the user.
  //
  void silly( int &amp;count )
  {
      int i;

      for( i = 0; i &lt; count; i++ ) {
          std::cout &lt;&lt; "I am silly!\n";
      }
  }
</pre>

<p>Suppose the main function looked like</p>

<pre class="code">
  int main( )
  {
      silly( 100 );
      return 0;
  }
</pre>

<p>It seems like this would print the silly message 100 times. In fact, it produces a compile
  error. Why? The function <span class="code">silly</span> takes its parameter by reference. The
  compiler assumes that the function might therefor want to modify the object referred to by that
  reference. Yet in my main function above, I am giving <span
      class="code">silly</span> a literal number. That doesn't make sense. How could <span
      class="code">silly</span> possibly modify the literal constant "100"? This issue doesn't
  come up when you pass parameters by value because in that case the 100 is copied into the
  parameter. The function couldn't change the original 100 even if it wanted to.</p>

<p>Now it happens that <span class="code">silly</span> does not really try to modify its
  parameter. It only reads the value of <span class="code">count</span>. It never writes to it. I
  can express this fact by defining <span class="code">silly</span> so that it takes a reference
  to a const. It looks like this</p>

<pre class="code">
  //
  // This function annoys the user.
  //
  void silly( const int &amp;count )
  {
      int i;

      for( i = 0; i &lt; count; i++ ) {
          std::cout &lt;&lt; "I am silly!\n";
      }
  }
</pre>

<p>The only difference is in the <span class="code">const</span> that appears in the parameter
  list. Read <span class="code">const int &amp;count</span> as "<span
      class="code">count</span> is a reference to a constant int". This declaration tells the
  compiler that the function never writes to the object referred to by that reference. The
  compiler will enforce this; inside the function <span class="code">count</span> is treated as a
  constant int. It also means that when you do <span class="code">silly(100)</span> the compiler
  allows it since it knows for sure that <span class="code">silly</span> will not try to modify
  the 100.</p>

<p>This is all very fine, but you might wonder what happens when you try to give silly a "normal"
  (non-const) object like this</p>

<pre class="code">
  int main( )
  {
      int annoyance = 100;

      silly( annoyance );
      return 0;
  }
</pre>

<p>Here <span class="code">annoyance</span> is an ordinary integer object that could be modified.
  Yet when <span class="code">silly</span> is called, it is not an error. Just because <span
      class="code">silly</span> takes a reference to a constant does not mean it must be used only
  with constants. It just means that <span class="code">silly</span> promises to not write to the
  object it is given. If the object is writable that is fine. The function <span class="code">silly</span>
  doesn't care.</p>

<p>In general if you write a function with a reference parameter and if that function does not
  modify the object referred to by that parameter, you should declare that parameter as a
  reference to a const. You will see many, many examples of this in the future. In a later lesson
  I will explain why it is essential that you follow this rule.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<ol id="summary-list">
  <li><p>C++ is approximately a super set of C and thus most C programs will compile without
    changes as C++ programs.</p></li>

  <li><p>The entire C++ standard library is in namespace <span class="code">std</span>. When you

  <li><p>A reference is an alias for something else. When you declare a stand-alone reference you
    must bind it to an object. Reference parameters are bound to a function's arguments when that
    function is called.</p></li>

  <li><p>If a function takes a reference parameter and the function does not change that
    parameter, then the parameter should be declared as a reference to const. This allows the
    function to be used in situations where the compiler would otherwise prohibit it.</p></li>
