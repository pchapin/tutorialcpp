<h2>Body</h2>

<h3>What are IOStreams?</h3>

<p>The IOStreams library is a very powerful library for doing input/output (I/O) operations. It
  provides all the I/O features of the C standard library and it can be extended in four
  significant ways that the C library can't.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>C++ allows you to create your own data types. With IOStreams you can define how to do I/O
      operations for your types and use those operations in your program in a natural way. This
      would be like defining your own format specifiers (<span class="code">%d</span>, <span
          class="code">%f</span>, etc) for <span class="code">printf</span>.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>You can arrange things so that the standard IOStreams functions will do I/O operations on
      any I/O device you can imagine. The C standard library really only understands files or
      things that look like files. That may cover a lot of ground, but it isn't as flexible as it
      could be. The IOStreams library can be taught to use windows, network connections, raw
      memory, or any other sequential device as an I/O device.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>When using IOStreams you can change the meaning of "character" so that the library
      transfers not just simple characters of ASCII text but any other character-like entity you
      might want.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>You can define your own "manipulators" to control the state of the I/O device without
      resorting to specialized control functions.</p>
  </li>

</ol>

<p>If these features don't make sense to you, don't worry about it. They are, for the most part,
  advanced topics. In this course we will do a bit of #1, but we won't talk further about the
  other possibilities at all. My point here is to convince you that IOStreams is worth learning.
  Later you may want to do some advanced things with it, and you'll need to understand the basics
  that we will cover here first.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that IOStreams is just a library. It is not built into the language. Thus the
  techniques used by IOStreams could be used in libraries of your own creation. Furthermore since
  IOStreams is a standard part of C++, using such techniques would actually make your own
  libraries easier to understand in the long run. All C++ programmers know at least something
  about IOStreams. Anything that uses IOStreams or resembles IOStreams will make sense to all C++
  programmers.</p>

<h3>The basics</h3>

<p>Unlike the standard C I/O library, IOStreams functions are declared in several header files. In
  C, you can just #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;, but to use IOStreams you may need to #include several
  files. Here are the common ones.</p>

<pre class="code">
  #include &lt;iostream&gt;  // Needed for the basic operations.
  #include &lt;iomanip&gt;   // Manipulators with parameters.
  #include &lt;fstream&gt;   // Needed for I/O to and from files.
  #include &lt;sstream&gt;   // Needed for I/O to and from standard strings.
</pre>

<p>There are other headers too, but they are mostly only needed for exotic operations. We won't
  worry about them here.</p>

<p>In C the operators <span class="code">&lt;&lt;</span> and <span
    class="code">&gt;&gt;</span> are used to do bit shift operations on integers. You can use them
  that way in C++ too, but C++ allows you to redefine the meaning of most operators when they are
  applied to user defined types. The IOStreams library uses that facility extensively to change
  the meaning of <span class="code">&lt;&lt;</span> and <span
      class="code">&gt;&gt;</span> when they are applied to stream objects. In fact, because I/O
  is much more common than bit shifting, under C++ the original meaning of those operators has
  become secondary.</p>

<p>The <span class="code">&lt;&lt;</span> operator is called the <i>inserter</i> operator because
  you use it to insert things into a stream. The <span class="code">&gt;&gt;</span> operator is
  called the <i>extractor</i> operator because you use it to extract things from a stream. Keep in
  mind that a stream is just a sequence of characters. When you insert a character into an output
  stream that character is sent to the corresponding output device. When you extract a character
  from an input stream, you are getting the next character from the corresponding input device.
</p>

<p>When you #include &lt;iostream&gt; you make available several global stream objects.</p>

<pre class="code">
  std::cout    // Standard output
  std::cin     // Standard input
  std::cerr    // Standard error
</pre>

<p>These objects are of user defined type (<span class="code">std::cout</span> and <span
    class="code">std::cerr</span> are of type <span class="code">std::ostream</span>; <span
    class="code">std::cin</span> is of type <span class="code">std::istream</span>). The exact
  nature of these objects does not concern us. All we need to know is that we can insert things
  into a <span class="code">std::ostream</span> and extract things from a <span
      class="code">std::istream</span>. How that works exactly is part of the library and hidden
  from the casual IOStreams user.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the standard output device is normally the console's display, the standard
  input device is the console's keyboard, and the standard error device is also the console's
  display. These associations can be changed using I/O redirection at the command line. However,
  I/O redirection is handled by the operating system and is not something the program even knows
  is happening (that is the beauty of it).</p>

<p>There are overloadings of <span class="code">&lt;&lt;</span> (for ostreams) and <span
    class="code">&gt;&gt;</span> (for istreams) that apply to all the built in types.</p>

<pre class="code">
  #include &lt;iostream&gt;

  int main( )
  {
      int   i = 10;
      long  l = 20;
      char  c = 'X';
      float f = 3.14F;
      const char *p = "Hello, World\n";

      std::cout &lt;&lt; i;  // Prints '10' on the standard output device.
      std::cout &lt;&lt; l;  // Prints '20'
      std::cout &lt;&lt; c;  // Prints 'X'
      std::cout &lt;&lt; f;  // Prints '3.14000'
      std::cout &lt;&lt; p;  // Prints 'Hello, World'
      return 0;
  }
</pre>

<p>Unlike with <span class="code">printf</span>, you don't need to worry about picking the right
  format specifier. The compiler selects the appropriate version of <span
      class="code">&lt;&lt;</span> for you based on the type of the object you are trying to
  insert. This is one advantage IOStreams has over the traditional C I/O library and is often
  called <i>type-safe I/O.</i></p>

<p>You can also read values by extracting them from the input object.</p>

<pre class="code">
  #include &lt;iostream&gt;

  int main( )
  {
      int age;

      std::cout &lt;&lt; "How old are you? ";
      std::cin  &gt;&gt; age;
      std::cout &lt;&lt; "So you say that you are " &lt;&lt; age &lt;&lt; " years old?";
      return 0;
  }
</pre>

<p>The program above demonstrates several other features of IOStreams. Because of the way operator
  <span class="code">&lt;&lt;</span> works, you can chain together uses of it as expected. A
  statement such as:</p>

<pre class="code">
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "So you say that you are " &lt;&lt; age &lt;&lt; " years old?";
</pre>

<p>is handled as:</p>

<pre class="code">
  ((std::cout &lt;&lt; "So you say that you are ") &lt;&lt; age) &lt;&lt; " years old?";
</pre>

<p>Each application of <span class="code">&lt;&lt;</span> returns its left operand (by reference).
  Thus the value of:</p>

<pre class="code">
  (std::cout &lt;&lt; "So you say that you are ")
</pre>

<p>is just <span class="code">std::cout</span> again. This means that <span
    class="code">std::cout</span> becomes the left operand in the next application of <span
    class="code">&lt;&lt;</span>.</p>

<p>The extraction operator works somewhat like <span class="code">scanf</span> and has the same
  sort of quirks. It will skip leading white space and it needs to look ahead by one character. As
  a result, like <span class="code">scanf</span>, it can be somewhat difficult to use. However,
  you can also call <i>methods</i> of the stream classes in order to do things that are not
  possible with the inserter/extractor mechanism. I will talk about methods extensively in a later
  lesson. For now note that the way I perform a named operation on a stream is by using a "."
  operator (like accessing a member of a structure). Here is how you would read the standard input
  one character at a time.</p>

<pre class="code">
  #include &lt;iostream&gt;

  int main( )
  {
      char ch;

      while( std::cin.get( ch ) ) {
          // Process ch
      }
      return 0;
  }
</pre>

<p>The <span class="code">get</span> method returns a character into <span
    class="code">ch</span> by reference (no need to pass a pointer) and it also returns a <span
    class="code">false</span> value when the end-of-file is encountered. There is also a version
  of <span class="code">get</span> that can read an entire line.</p>

<pre class="code">
  #include &lt;iostream&gt;

  int main( )
  {
      char line_buffer[256 + 1];

      while( std::cin.get( line_buffer, 256 + 1 ) ) {
          // Process the line in line_buffer
      }
      return 0;
  }
</pre>

<p>However, if you really wanted to read a file a line at a time, you would probably use the <span
    class="code">std::string</span> type. Standard strings can grow to any size necessary so there
  is no need to worry about overflowing buffers in that case. I will talk about <span
      class="code">std::string</span> in a later lesson.</p>

<h3>Manipulators</h3>

<p>There are also a number of special objects called <i>manipulators</i> that change the status of
  a stream. By inserting these manipulators into a stream, you can control the way the stream
  behaves. It is possible to create your own manipulators if necessary but the standard library
  provides a number of useful ones already.</p>

<pre class="code">
  std::flush // Flush the output buffer.
  std::endl  // Inserts a '\n' into the output stream and flushes the output buffer.
  std::ends  // Inserts a null character into an output stream.
  std::ws	   // Extracts white space from an input stream and throws it away.

  std::setw(int)         // Sets the width of the next field only.
  std::setfill(char)     // Sets the fill character.
  std::setprecision(int) // Sets the number of significant digits for float numbers.
</pre>

<p>The manipulators without parameters are all declared in &lt;iostream&gt;. If you need to use a
  manipulator that takes parameters, you will need to also #include &lt;iomanip&gt;.</p>

<p>Here is an example it illustrate how some of these manipulators work. This statement:</p>

<pre class="code">
  std::cout &lt;&lt; '(' &lt;&lt; std::setw(4) &lt;&lt; std::setfill('#') &lt;&lt; 12 &lt;&lt; ')';
</pre>

<p>produces: <span class="terminal">(##12)</span> on the output stream. The <span
    class="code">std::setw</span> manipulator sets the field width of the next field to four. The
  <span class="code">std::setfill</span> manipulator sets the fill character to '#'. Since the
  number being printed is only two characters long, the other two spaces in the field are filled
  with '#'. Note that the <span class="code">std::setw</span> manipulator only affects the next
  field (single character output fields are not affected), but the <span
      class="code">std::setfill</span> manipulator affects all following fields until it is used
  again to set the fill character to something else.</p>

<p>As you can see, manipulators are used to control the format of the output and play a role
  similar to that played by the various control characters allowed in <span
      class="code">printf</span>'s format string. Using manipulators tends to be more verbose than
  an equivalent printf format string, but manipulators are much for flexible and extensible than
  <span class="code">printf</span>.</p>

<h3>File I/O</h3>

<p>Doing file I/O with IOStreams is easy. If you wish to write to a file, you need to declare an
  object of type <span class="code">std::ofstream</span>. If you wish to read from a file, you
  need to declare an object of type <span class="code">std::ifstream</span>. The act of declaring
  these objects opens the files as appropriate. The files will be closed automatically by the
  IOStreams library; you do not have to worry about closing them yourself. Once a file is open,
  you can treat it like any other stream object.</p>

<p>Here is a program that opens a file and displays its contents on the standard output device.
  Notice how I have to #include &lt;fstream&gt; if I want to use <span
      class="code">std::ofstream</span> or <span class="code">std::ifstream</span>.</p>

<pre class="code">
  #include &lt;iostream&gt;
  #include &lt;fstream&gt;

  int main( )
  {
      char          ch;
      std::ifstream input_file( "input.txt" );
          // Declare the object and open the file.

      // Did the open work?
      if( !input_file ) {
          std::cerr &lt;&lt; "Can't open input.txt for reading!\n";
          return 1;
      }

      // Read the input file one character at a time.
      while( input_file.get( ch ) ) {
          std::cout.put( ch );
      }
      return 0;
  }
</pre>

<p>Notice how I print error messages to <span class="code">std::cerr</span>. This is the
  traditional way to do it. I could have used <span class="code">std::cout</span> instead, but it
  makes a difference when I/O redirection is being used (users typically want to see error
  messages even if they have redirected the standard output to a file).</p>

<p>Notice also that I didn't have to use the <span class="code">std::</span> qualifier all that
  often. Once I declared <span class="code">input_file</span> to be type <span
      class="code">std::ifstream</span> I no longer needed to qualify my use of <span
      class="code">input_file</span>. Although <span class="code">input_file</span>'s type is a
  standard library type, the name <span class="code">input_file itself</span> is not in name space
  <span class="code">std</span>. This is a common situation. Since C++ programs often make heavy
  use of new types defined in libraries, once the objects are declared few additional namespace
  qualifications are necessary.</p>

<h3>String I/O</h3>

<p>Just as files are places where characters can be stored sequentially, so also are strings. The
  IOStreams library allows itself to be extended to cover any sequential storage device. Because
  strings are so important and commonly used, the standard provides the necessary facilities to do
  I/O to strings. However, in order to discuss that fully, you need to know something about the
  <span class="code">std::string</span> type. I will thus wait and talk about how you can do I/O
  to strings when I talk about strings in a later lesson.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<ol id="summary-list">

  <li>
    <p>Although C++ programs can use the C standard I/O library, the C++ IOStreams library is much
      more powerful and extensible. You should get in the habit of using IOStreams in your C++
      programs now so that when you want to make use of its advanced features you will have the
      experience to do so.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>You can write to the standard output device by using the <span
        class="code">&lt;&lt;</span> operator on the <span class="code">std::cout</span> object.
      You can read from the standard input device by using the <span
          class="code">&gt;&gt;</span> operator on the <span class="code">std::cin</span> object.
      These operators behave similarly to C's <span class="code">printf</span> and <span
          class="code">scanf</span> functions. They do formatted I/O. Unformatted,
      character-at-a-time I/O is also possible using stream method functions.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>I/O manipulators are special objects that can be pushed into a stream to change the
      stream's state. They are typically used to control the formatting of other output.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Data can be read from a file by declaring a <span class="code">std::ifstream</span> object
      and then using it like any other input stream. Data can be written to a file by declaring a
      <span class="code">std::ofstream</span> object and then using it like any other output
      stream. You must #include &lt;fstream&gt; to use these two library types.</p>
  </li>
