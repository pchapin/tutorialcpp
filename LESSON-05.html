<h1>Lesson #5</h1>

<p class="subtitle">Abstract Data Types</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>In this lesson I will cover the following topics:</p>

<ol id="overview-list">
  <li><p>Constructors</p></li>

  <li><p>Inline methods</p></li>

  <li><p>Introduction to overloaded functions and operators.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Body</h2>

<h3>Attachment</h3>

<p>During this lesson I will make several references to a simple date class. That class is
  contained in the files <a href="Date.hpp">Date.hpp</a> and <a href="Date.cpp">Date.cpp</a> and
  should be available from the web page where you got this lesson.</p>

<p>My date class is covered by the GNU General Public License (GPL). In compliance with the
  requirements of that license, I have also placed a link to a copy of the GPL on the web page.
  For more information on the GPL see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">http://www.gnu.org/</a>.</p>

<p>This date class is serviceable, but it lacks many useful features that a serious date class
  might have. It is also very inefficient. However, it serves my purposes in this lesson. I invite
  you to enhance the class as an exercise.</p>

<h3>Constructors</h3>

<p>My money example in the last lesson had a set method that you could use to give a <span
    class="code">money</span> object a value. That was fine. Yet with the built-in types you can
  initialize an object when you declare it like this</p>

<pre class="code">
int sum = 0;
</pre>

<p>You can do something similar with class objects by defining a special method called a <i>constructor</i>.
  The constructor method for a class is called automatically by the compiler when an object of
  that class is created. You can use the constructor method to initialize your object to some
  known, valid state. Instead of having your objects start off with indeterminate values, they can
  start off with perfectly well-defined values.</p>

<p>Take a look at the Date.hpp header file that I attached to this lesson. The <span class="code">Date</span>
  class implements the concept of calendar dates in a way that is easy and natural to use in your
  program. The very first method declared in the public section (notice how I put the public
  section first) has the same name as the class. That means it is a constructor.</p>

<pre class="code">
class Date {
public:
    Date( );

    // etc...
};
</pre>

<p>Notice how constructors do not mention a return type in their declaration. This is required. If
  you specify a return type with a constructor&mdash;even void&mdash;it is an error.</p>

<p>Normally you would expect to find the implementation of the constructor in the Date.cpp file.
  It might look like this:</p>

<pre class="code">
Date::Date( )
{
    D = 1;
    M = 1;
    Y = 1970;
}
</pre>

<p>Again notice how the return type is not specified. This function sets the date object to
  January 1, 1970 by default. If you look at the private section of the date class you will see
  that it is using the "obvious" representation of a date as three integer values: one for the day
  of the month, one for the month of the year, and one for the year itself.</p>

<p>Since this function is so short, the overhead involved in calling it is a significant
  percentage of the time to execute it. To improve performance, C++ allows you to specify that a
  function should be expanded <i>inline</i> by the compiler. The bodies of such functions are put
  directly into the code where the function is called. No call or return instructions are
  generated by the compiler (and no stack manipulation is done). This makes executing the function
  faster.</p>

<p>There are a couple of ways to specify that a function should be inline. One is to put its body
  directly in the class definition. That is the method used for the date constructor.</p>

<pre class="code">
class Date {
public:
    Date( ) { D = 1; M = 1; Y = 1970; }
    // etc...
};
</pre>

<p>Notice that I formatted this function a little differently than normal. That is acceptable in a
  case like this, I feel, because the function is so short. A longer format such as:</p>

<pre class="code">
class Date {
public:
    Date( )
    {
      D = 1;
      M = 1;
      Y = 1970;
    }
    // etc...
};
</pre>

<p>is perfectly acceptable to the compiler, but just seems overly distracting in this situation.
  This is a case where bending the rules is desirable.</p>

<p>The purpose of this constructor is to initialize a date to something meaningful. In the program
  below, the date named <span class="code">start</span> has an initial value of January 1, 1970,
  even though the programmer did not do anything to explicitly set this up. The constructor
  function is called automatically by the compiler when the object is declared.</p>

<pre class="code">
int main( )
{
    vtsu::Date start;

    // etc...
}
</pre>

<p>C++ allows you to define many functions with the same name provided they have parameter lists
  that differ sufficiently for the compiler to tell them apart. This feature is called <i>function
    overloading</i>. It applies to normal functions and methods, and it also applies to
  constructors. The constructor taking no parameters is normally called the <i>default
    constructor</i> because it is used to initialize an object in a default way. However, my date
  class also contains a constructor taking three integer parameters that can be used to initialize
  a <span class="code">Date</span> to something other than the default value.</p>

<pre class="code">
class Date {
public:
    // etc...

    Date( int day, int month, int year )
        { set( day, month, year ); }

    // etc...
};
</pre>

<p>This constructor just makes an inline call to the class's <span class="code">set</span> method
  to do the dirty work of setting the date accordingly. It might be used like this:</p>

<pre class="code">
int main( )
{
    vtsu::Date my_birthday( 7, 9, 1960 );

    // etc...
}
</pre>

<p>Here the date object <span class="code">my_birthday</span> is being initialized to September 7,
  1960. The use of parentheses to initialize an object is new with C++, but it is necessary here
  because the constructor takes three parameters and there is no syntax in C for doing
  initialization in that situation. For consistency, the parentheses are also allowed in C++ when
  initializing built in objects. For example:</p>

<pre class="code">
int sum( 0 );
</pre>

<p>declares <span class="code">sum</span> to be an integer and initializes it to zero. This style
  of initialization is called <i>function-like</i> initialization since it looks similar to
  calling a function.</p>

<p>There is a potential ambiguity related to function-like initialization syntax. If you squint at
  the declaration of <span class="code">sum</span> above, it appears almost to be a declaration of
  a <em>function</em> named <span class="code">sum</span> that returns an integer. You can tell it
  isn't a declaration of a function because what is inside the parentheses is an expression used
  as a constructor argument and not a declaration of a parameter, as would be the case for a
  function declaration. Nevertheless, there are situations where there is an ambiguity. In those
  cases, the compiler will report an error, and you will need to use explicit type conversions or
  other trickery to disambiguate. Fortunately, those situations are rare.</p>

<p>If you have a constructor that takes only one parameter you can use the equal sign to
  initialize objects with that constructor. The <span class="code">Date</span> class does not have
  such a constructor, but for purposes of illustration suppose the <span class="code">Money</span>
  class from the last lesson did:</p>

<pre class="code">
class Money {
public:
    Money( long D ) { dollars = D; cents = 0; }
    // etc...
};
</pre>

<p>Then you could say:</p>

<pre class="code">
vtsu::Money account_balance = 100;
  // Initialize the account_balance to 100 dollars (and zero cents).
</pre>

<p>Some C++ programmers use the function-like initialization syntax all the time since it is the
  same for all objects (and for subtle technical reasons it might be faster in some cases). In
  cases where there is a choice, I tend to use whichever syntax is more natural looking.</p>

<p>Constructors are very powerful. Although they are intended to initialize the object they are
  constructing, they are completely general functions and can do anything. Some classes have
  constructors that read configuration files, interact with the user, allocate graphical
  resources, and so forth. The constructor does whatever is necessary to get the object "up and
  running." For complicated abstract objects that might be quite a lot.</p>

<p>The compiler will use the constructors you define whenever it is appropriate to do so. Here are
  some examples:</p>

<pre class="code">
int main( )
{
    vtsu::Date process_dates[16];
      // An array of date objects. All are initialized with the default constructor.

    vtsu::Date birthdates[] = {
        vtsu::Date( 23,  8, 1948 ), vtsu::Date( 31, 10, 1950 ), vtsu::Date( 7,  9, 1960 )
    };

    // etc...
}
</pre>

<p>In the second example I'm initializing an array of dates using the constructor that takes three
  parameters. The expressions <span class="code">Date(...)</span> tell the compiler to use the
  constructor to build a date object using the given parameters. The <span
      class="code">birthdates</span> array has three date objects in it.</p>

<h3>Destructors</h3>

<p>No discussion of constructors would be complete without saying a few words about destructors.
  Although my <span class="code">Date</span> example does not use any destructors, most classes
  do.</p>

<p>A destructor is a special method that the compiler calls when an object is about to cease to
  exist. For example, it is called for local objects when the local objects go out of scope. It is
  used to clean up the object and return any resources the object was using back to the system.
  Here is how it might look:</p>

<pre class="code">
class Example {
public:
    Example() { std::cout &lt;&lt; "I'm in Example::Example( )"  << std::endl; }
   ~Example() { std::cout &lt;&lt; "I'm in Example::~Example( )" << std::endl; }
};

int main( )
{
    Example object;

    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>The destructor has the same name as the class, just like the constructor, and it has no return
  type specified. However, its name also has a '~' in it as shown in the example above. My class
  <span class="code">Example</span> shows both the constructor and destructor as inline functions.
</p>

<p>When <span class="code">object</span> is initialized its constructor will be called. Just
  before <span class="code">main</span> returns, <span class="code">object</span> is destroyed and
  its destructor will be called. Thus, the output of the program is</p>

<pre class="terminal">
I'm in Example::Example( )
Hello, World!
I'm in Example::~Example( )
</pre>

<p>Try it and see!</p>

<p>Destructors make it easy to ensure that things are cleaned up properly. Do you remember how I
  said that you don't have to worry about closing files when you use IOStreams? That's because the
  destructors of classes <span class="code">ifstream</span> and <span
      class="code">ofstream</span> close the files for you. When a file stream object goes out of
  scope, that detail is automatically handled. The <span class="code">Date</span> class I provided
  as an example with this lesson has no clean up needs. Hence, there is no destructor. We will
  look at some classes that do need destructors soon.</p>

<h3>Other Date operations</h3>

<p>In addition to the constructors and the set operation, class <span class="code">Date</span>
  provides a few other operations. It provides <i>accessor methods</i> that can be used to get at
  the components of a <span class="code">Date</span>. They are declared in the class as:</p>

<pre class="code">
int day( )   const { return D; }
int month( ) const { return M; }
int year( )  const { return Y; }
</pre>

<p>These are also inline functions since the overhead in calling them would otherwise be huge
  compared to the time to execute them. They are trivial in this implementation of <span
      class="code">Date</span>, but they are provided anyway so that the implementation is
  properly hidden. As I will discuss shortly there are other ways of representing dates besides
  this obvious one and these functions would become much more complicated with some of those
  alternative representations.</p>

<p>The word <span class="code">const</span> that appears after the function header means that
  these are <i>const methods</i>. That means they can be applied to a constant <span class="code">Date</span>
  object. C++ allows class objects to be constants just like built-in objects. Here is how that
  might look:
</p>

<pre class="code">
int main( )
{
    const vtsu::Date my_birthday( 7, 9, 1960 );
      // While the constructor is executing the object is not constant.
      // When the constructor finishes, the object will be treated as
      // a constant.

    my_birthday.set( 29, 4, 1954 );
      // Error! set is not a const method and thus can't be used on a
      // constant object.

    if( my_birthday.year( ) &lt; 1970 ) { ...
      // Fine. Year can be applied to a constant object because it is a
      // const method.

    // etc...
}
</pre>

<p>The idea is that the functions that return the state of the object do not normally change that
  state. Because they just read the object and don't write to it, I declared them to be <span
      class="code">const</span>. The compiler will allow those functions to be used on constant
  dates and that is reasonable. The compiler enforces this concept to a certain degree. Inside a
  const method, all the data members of the class are taken to be constants. Any expression inside
  the const method that attempts to modify a data member is an error.</p>

<p>Note: There are issues here that are beyond the scope of this lesson and C++'s handling of
  those issues is not 100% satisfactory. In any case, the notion of a const method is useful and
  commonly applied.</p>

<p>The only other public operation supported on dates by this class is <span
    class="code">advance</span>. It is used to change the value stored in a <span class="code">Date</span>
  object. Here is an example:</p>

<pre class="code">
int main( )
{
    vtsu::Date my_birthday( 7, 9, 1960 );

    my_birthday.advance( 1000 );
    // etc...
}
</pre>

<p>Here I'm computing the date 1000 days after my birthday and putting the result back into <span
    class="code">my_birthday</span>. In other words, I'm advancing the date stored in <span
    class="code">my_birthday</span> by 1000 days. Notice that this operation modifies the internal
  state of <span class="code">my_birthday</span>. It does not return a new date object. You can
  define your methods to work either way. There are pros and cons to both approaches. For now, I
  will leave a detailed discussion of those issues for a later lesson.</p>

<h3>Operations that are not class methods</h3>

<p>In addition to the methods, there are several operations on dates that I implemented as
  ordinary functions. The first two are overloaded versions of the comparison operators <span
      class="code">==</span> and <span class="code">&lt;</span>. C++ allows you to define the
  meaning of most operators as applied to class types. This is done by creating functions with odd
  looking names like <span
      class="code">operator==</span> and <span
      class="code">operator&lt;</span>. These functions are ordinary in every way except for their
  names. However, the compiler will use these functions whenever you use the corresponding
  operators. For example:</p>

<pre class="code">
void do_stuff( const vtsu::Date &amp;incoming )
{
    vtc::date baseline(1, 1, 2000);

    if (incoming &lt; baseline) {
        // The incoming date is before the baseline date.
    }
    else {
        // The incoming date is the same as or later than the baseline date.
    }
}
</pre>

<p>When I say <span class="code">incoming &lt; baseline</span> the compiler treats that as a
  function call like <span class="code">operator&lt;(incoming, baseline)</span>. Providing
  overloaded operators is a nice way to make using your class very natural. I will talk about
  operator overloading in some detail in the next lesson.</p>

<p>Notice that it is only necessary to define two of the six relational operators. The other four
  are easily defined in terms of the first two. They are defined as inline functions using the
  reserved word <span class="code">inline</span>. This is necessary because they are not class
  methods.</p>

<p>In addition to overloaded relational operators, I provided overloaded versions of the inserter
  and extractor operators to making doing I/O on dates natural as well. Here is a complete program
  that calculates how old you are in days.</p>

<pre class="code">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include "Date.hpp"

int main( )
{
    vtsu::Date birthday;
    vtsu::Date today;

    std::cout &lt;&lt; "What is your birthday? ";
    std::cin  &gt;&gt; birthday;
      // This calls my overloaded extractor operator to get a date.

    std::cout &lt;&lt; "What is today's date? ";
    std::cin  &gt;&gt; today;

    std::cout &lt;&lt; "You are " &lt;&lt; today - birthday &lt;&lt; " days old.";
      // This calls my overloaded operator- to compute the number of days
      // between two Date objects. The result is a long integer which
      // is then printed.

    return 0;
}
</pre>

<h3>Private member functions</h3>

<p>Just as it is possible (but not recommended) to have public data members, it is also possible
  to have private methods. The <span class="code">Date</span> class has <span
      class="code">is_leap</span>, <span
      class="code">month_length</span>, <span class="code">next</span>, and <span
      class="code">previous</span> methods that are private. These methods can only be called by
  other methods. They can't be used by users of <span class="code">Date</span> in general. They
  are helper methods that just make the job of implementing the public methods a bit easier. In a
  future version of <span class="code">Date</span>, with a different internal representation,
  these functions might no longer exist. Notice that <span
      class="code">is_leap</span> and <span class="code">month_length</span> are const methods.
  This is because they do not change the value stored in a <span class="code">Date</span> object.
</p>

<h3>Information hiding revisited</h3>

<p>The <span class="code">Date</span> implementation I've been talking about so far uses the
  obvious way of representing a date. Storing the day, month, and year separately makes it very
  easy to do I/O operations with humans since humans expect to see and use dates in that form.
  However, it is very awkward to do computations with dates in that form because of the
  peculiarities of our calendar.</p>

<p>An alternative implementation for dates might look like this:</p>

<pre class="code">
class Date {
private:
    long JD_number;

    // etc...
};
</pre>

<p>Here instead of storing the day, month, and year separately I store a single julian day number.
  Every day in history has a unique julian day number (starting from an obscure date around 4700
  BCE). This approach makes computing with dates trivial. To find the number of days between two
  dates, simply subtract the julian day numbers. To advance a date by a given number of days,
  simply add the desired interval to the date's julian day number.</p>

<p>The downside of this implementation is that now I/O operations on dates are complicated. Humans
  don't normally want to see julian day numbers and so elaborate conversion functions are
  necessary to support the natural form of a date that humans expect.</p>

<p>The key point to realize is this: you can switch the internal representation of <span
    class="code">Date</span> from one form to another any time you want. You will need to rewrite
  all the class methods to take into account the new internal structure of the class, but programs
  that use the class will only need to be recompiled. In this case, switching from the obvious
  representation of dates to the julian day number representation makes the I/O methods harder
  (and slower) and the computational methods easier (and faster). Some methods that were inline
  will probably become non-inline while some methods that were not inline will probably become
  inline. This is all normal and reasonable. The clients of the <span class="code">Date</span>
  class do not need to know. This is an incredibly important capability.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<ol id="summary-list">
  <li><p>Classes can define a special method with the same name as the class that is used to
    initialize objects of that class when they are declared. This method is called the
    constructor. By defining suitable constructors for your classes, you can make sure that every
    object created is in a well-defined state before it is used. This is a very powerful
    facility.</p></li>

  <li><p>Although class methods are often defined in a separate .cpp file, it is possible to
    define them right in the class definition (in a header file). Such methods are said to be
    inline, and the compiler should, in many cases, be able to replace calls to those methods with
    their bodies directly. In other words, calling an inline method is faster because no actual
    CALL instruction is generated by the compiler.</p>
    <p>It is also possible to explicitly declare a function to be inline using the <span
        class="code">inline</span> reserved word.</p></li>

  <li><p>It is possible to define multiple functions or methods (including constructors) with the
    same name as long as the parameter lists for those functions or methods are sufficiently
    different. For example, you can declare two different print functions like this:</p>

    <pre class="code">
void print( int );
void print( char * );
</pre>

    <p>The compiler figures out which one to call based on the argument types. Thus:</p>

    <pre class="code">
print( 10 );       // Calls print( int )
print( "Hello" );  // Calls print( char * )
print( 0 );        // Ambiguous. Compile error. The literal zero might be a null pointer.
</pre>

    <p>Note that overloaded functions are completely independent. They have the same name as each
      other, but they do not need to do the same thing (to prevent confusion, all functions with
      the same name should probably have similar purposes).</p></li>
