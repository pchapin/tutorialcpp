<h2>Body</h2>

<h3>Attachment</h3>

<p>During this lesson I will make several references to a simple date class that I created. That
  class is contained in the files date.hpp and date.cpp and should be available from the web page
  where you got this lesson.</p>

<p>My date class is covered by the GNU General Public License (GPL). In compliance with the
  requirements of that license I have also placed a link to a copy of the GPL on the web page. For
  more information on the GPL see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/"
  >http://www.gnu.org/</a>.</p>

<p>This date class is serviceable, but it lacks many useful features that a serious date class
  might have. It is also very inefficient. However, it serves my purposes in this lesson quite
  well. I invite you to enhance the class as an exercise.</p>

<h3>Constructors</h3>

<p>My money example in the last lesson had a set method that you could use to give a <span
    class="code">money</span> object a value. That was fine. Yet with the built-in types you can
  initialize an object when you declare it like this</p>

<pre class="code">
int sum = 0;
</pre>

<p>It turns out that you can do something similar with class objects by defining a special method
  called a <i>constructor</i>. The constructor method for a class is called automatically by the
  compiler when an object of that class is created. You can use the constructor method to
  initialize your object to some known, valid state. Instead of having your objects start off with
  indeterminate values, they can start off with perfectly well defined values.</p>

<p>Take a look at the date.hpp header file that I attached to this lesson. The date class
  implements the concept of calendar dates in a way that is easy and natural to use in your
  program. The very first method declared in the public section (notice how I put the public
  section first) has the same name as the class. That means it is a constructor.</p>

<pre class="code">
class date {

  public:
    date();

    // etc...
};
</pre>

<p>Notice how constructors do not mention a return type in their declaration. This is required. If
  you specify a return type with a constructor&mdash;even void&mdash;it is an error.</p>

<p>Normally you would expect to find the implementation of the constructor in the date.cpp file.
  It might look like this</p>

<pre class="code">
date::date()
{
  D = 1;
  M = 1;
  Y = 1970;
}
</pre>

<p>Again notice how the return type is not specified. This function sets the date object to
  January 1, 1970 by default. If you look at the private section of the date class you will see
  that it is using the "obvious" representation of a date as three integer values: one for the day
  of the month, one for the month of the year, and one for the year itself.</p>

<p>Since this function is so short, the overhead involved in calling it is a significant
  percentage of the time to execute it. To improve performance C++ allows you to specify that a
  function should be expanded <i>inline</i> by the compiler. The bodies of such functions are put
  directly into the code where the function is called. No call or return instructions are
  generated by the compiler (and no stack manipulation is done). This makes executing the function
  faster.</p>

<p>There are a couple of different ways to specify that a function should be inline. One is to put
  its body directly in the class definition. That is the method used for the date constructor.</p>

<pre class="code">
class date {
  public:
    date() { D = 1; M = 1; Y = 1970; }
    // etc...
};
</pre>

<p>Notice that I formatted this function a little differently than what is called for by the VTC
  style guide. That is acceptable in a case like this, I feel, because the function is so short. A
  longer format such as</p>

<pre class="code">
class date {
  public:
    date()
    {
      D = 1;
      M = 1;
      Y = 1970;
    }
    // etc...
};
</pre>

<p>is perfectly acceptable to the compiler, but just seems overly distracting in this situation.
  This is a case where bending the rules is desirable.</p>

<p>The purpose of this constructor is to initialize a date to something meaningful. In the program
  below, the date named <span class="code">start</span> has an initial value of January 1, 1970
  even though the programmer did not do anything to explicitly set this up. The constructor
  function is called automatically by the compiler when the object is declared.</p>

<pre class="code">
int main()
{
  vtc::date start;

  // etc...
}
</pre>

<p>C++ allows you to define many functions with the same name provided they have parameter lists
  that differs sufficiently for the compiler to tell them apart. This feature is called <i>function
    overloading</i>. It applies to normal functions and methods, and it also applies to
  constructors. The constructor taking no parameters is often called the <i>default
    constructor</i> because it is used to initialize an object by default. However, my date class
  also contains a constructor taking three integer parameters that can be used to initialize a
  date to something other than the default value.</p>

<pre class="code">
class date {
  public:
    // etc...

    date(int day, int month, int year)
      { set(day, month, year); }

    // etc...
};
</pre>

<p>This constructor just makes an inline call to the class's set method to do the dirty work of
  setting the date accordingly. It might be used like this:</p>

<pre class="code">
int main()
{
  vtc::date my_birthday(7, 9, 1960);

  // etc...
}
</pre>

<p>Here the date object <span class="code">my_birthday</span> is being initialized to September 7,
  1960. The use of parentheses to initialize an object is new with C++, but it is necessary here
  because the constructor takes three parameters and there is no syntax in C for doing
  initialization in that situation. For consistency the parentheses are also allowed in C++ when
  initializing built in objects. For example</p>

<pre class="code">
int sum(0);
</pre>

<p>declares sum to be an integer and initializes it to zero.</p>

<p>If you have a constructor that takes only one parameter you can use the equal sign to
  initialize objects with that constructor. The date class does not have such a constructor, but
  for purposes of illustration suppose the money class from the last lesson did</p>

<pre class="code">
class money {
  public:
    money(long D) { dollars = D; cents = 0; }
    // etc...
};
</pre>

<p>Then you could say</p>

<pre class="code">
vtc::money account_balance = 100;
  // Initialize the account_balance to 100 dollars (and zero cents).
</pre>

<p>Some C++ programmers use the new style initialization syntax all the time since it is the same
  for all objects (and for subtle technical reasons it might be faster in some cases). In cases
  where there is a choice, I tend to use whichever syntax is more natural looking.</p>

<p>Constructors are very powerful. Although they are intended to initialize the object they are
  constructing, they are completely general functions and can do anything at all. Some classes
  have constructors that read configuration files, interact with the user, allocate graphical
  resources, and so forth. The constructor does whatever is necessary to get the object "up and
  running." For complicated abstract objects that might be quite a lot.</p>

<p>The compiler will use the constructors you define whenever it is appropriate to do so. Here are
  some examples</p>

<pre class="code">
int main()
{
  vtc::date process_dates[16];
    // An array of date objects. All are initialized with the default constructor.

  vtc::date birthdates[] = {
    vtc::date(23,  8, 1948), vtc::date(31, 10, 1950), vtc::date( 7,  9, 1960)
  };

  // etc...
}
</pre>

<p>In the second example I'm initializing an array of dates using the constructor that takes three
  parameters. The expressions <span class="code">date(...)</span> tell the compiler to use the
  constructor to build a date object using the given parameters. The <span
      class="code">birthdates</span> array has three date objects in it.</p>

<h3>Destructors</h3>

<p>No discussion of constructors would be complete without saying a few words about destructors.
  Although my date example does not use any destructors, most classes do.</p>

<p>A destructor is a special method that the compiler calls when an object no longer exists. For
  example, it is called for local objects when the local objects go out of scope. It is used to
  clean up the object and return any resources the object was using back to the system. Here is
  how it might look:</p>

<pre class="code">
class example {
  public:
    example() { std::cout &lt;&lt; "I'm in example::example()\n";  }
   ~example() { std::cout &lt;&lt; "I'm in example::~example()\n"; }
};

int main()
{
  example object;

  std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, World!\n";
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>The destructor has the same name as the class, just like the constructor, and it has no return
  type specified. However, its name also has a '~' in it as shown in the example above. My class
  <span class="code">example</span> shows both the constructor and destructor as inline functions.
</p>

<p>When <span class="code">object</span> is initialized its constructor will be called. Just
  before <span class="code">main</span> returns, <span class="code">object</span> is destroyed and
  its destructor will be called. Thus the output of the program is</p>

<pre class="terminal">
I'm in example::example()
Hello, World!
I'm in example::~example()
</pre>

<p>Try it and see!</p>

<p>Destructors make it easy to insure that things are cleaned up properly. Do you remember how I
  said that you don't have to worry about closing files when you use IOStreams? That's because the
  destructors of classes <span class="code">ifstream</span> and <span
      class="code">ofstream</span> close the files for you. When a file stream object goes out of
  scope that detail is automatically handled. The date class I provided as an example with this
  lesson has no clean up needs. Hence there is no destructor. We will look at other classes that
  do need destructors soon.</p>

<h3>Other Date operations.</h3>

<p>In addition to the constructors and the set operation, class date provides a few other
  operations. It provides <i>access methods</i> that can be used to get at the components of a
  date. They are declared in the class as</p>

<pre class="code">
int day()   const { return D; }
int month() const { return M; }
int year()  const { return Y; }
</pre>

<p>These are also inline functions since the overhead in calling them would otherwise by huge
  compared to the time to execute them. They are trivial in this implementation of date, but they
  are provided anyway so that the implementation is properly hidden. As I will discuss shortly
  there are other ways of representing dates besides this obvious one and these functions would
  become much more complicated with some of those alternative representations.</p>

<p>The word <span class="code">const</span> that appears after the function header means that
  these are <i>constant methods</i>. That means they can be applied to a constant date object. C++
  allows class objects to be constants just like built-in objects. Here is how that might look:
</p>

<pre class="code">
int main()
{
  const vtc::date my_birthday(7, 9, 1960);
    // While the constructor is executing the object is not constant.
    // When the constructor finishes, the object will be treated as
    // a constant.

  my_birthday.set(29, 4, 1954);
    // Error! set is not a constant method and thus can't be used on a
    // constant object.

  if (my_birthday.year() &lt; 1970) { ...
    // Fine. Year can be applied to a constant object because it is a
    // constant method.

  // etc...
}
</pre>

<p>The idea here is that the functions that return the state of the object do not normally change
  that state. Because they just read the object and don't write to it, I declared them to be <span
      class="code">const</span>. Then the compiler will allow those functions to be used on
  constant dates and that is reasonable. The compiler enforces this concept to a certain degree.
  Inside a constant method all the data members of the class are taken to be constants. Any
  expression inside the constant method that attempts to modify a data member is an error.</p>

<p>Note: There are issues here that are beyond the scope of this lesson and C++'s handling of
  those issues is not 100% satisfactory. In any case, the notion of a constant method is useful
  and commonly applied.</p>

<p>The only other public operation supported on dates by this class is <span class="code"
>advance</span>. It is used to change the value stored in a date object. Here is an example:</p>

<pre class="code">
int main()
{
  Spica::date my_birthday(7, 9, 1960);

  my_birthday.advance(1000);
  // etc...
}
</pre>

<p>Here I'm computing the date 1000 days after my birthday and putting the result back into <span
    class="code">my_birthday</span>. In other words, I'm advancing the date stored in <span
    class="code">my_birthday</span> by 1000 days. Notice that this operation modifies the internal
  state of <span class="code">my_birthday</span>. It does not return a new date object. You can
  define your methods to work either way and there are pros and cons to both approaches. For now,
  I will leave a detailed discussion of those issues for a later lesson.</p>

<h3>Operations that are not class methods.</h3>

<p>In addition to the methods there are several operations on dates that I implemented as ordinary
  functions. The first two are overloaded versions of the comparison operators <span class="code">==</span>
  and <span class="code">&lt;</span>. C++ allows you to define the meaning of most operators as
  applied to class types. This is done by creating functions with odd looking names like <span
      class="code">operator==</span> and <span
      class="code">operator&lt;</span>. These functions are ordinary in every way except for their
  names. However, the compiler will use these functions whenever you use the corresponding
  operators. For example</p>

<pre class="code">
void do_stuff(const vtc::date &amp;incoming)
{
  vtc::date reference(1, 1, 2000);

  if (incoming &lt; reference) {
    // The incoming date is before the reference date.
  }
  else {
    // The incoming date is the same as or later than the reference date.
  }
}
</pre>

<p>When I say <span class="code">incoming &lt; reference</span> the compiler treats that as a
  function call like <span class="code">operator&lt;(incoming, reference)</span>. Providing
  overloaded operators is a nice way to make using your class very natural. I will talk about
  operator overloading in some detail in the next lesson.</p>

<p>Notice that it is only necessary to define two of the six relational operators. The other four
  are easily defined in terms of the first two. They are defined as inline functions using the
  reserved word <span class="code">inline</span>. This is necessary because they are not class
  methods.</p>

<p>In addition to overloaded relational operators, I provided overloaded versions of the inserter
  and extractor operators to making doing I/O on dates natural as well. Here is a little program
  that calculates how old you are in days.</p>

<pre class="code">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include "date.hpp"

int main()
{
  vtc::date birthday;
  vtc::date today;

  std::cout &lt;&lt; "What is your birthday? ";
  std::cin  &gt;&gt; birthday;
    // This calls my overloaded extractor operator to get a date.

  std::cout &lt;&lt; "What is today's date? ";
  std::cin  &gt;&gt; today;

  std::cout &lt;&lt; "You are " &lt;&lt; today - birthday &lt;&lt; " days old.";
    // This calls my overloaded operator- to compute the number of days
    // between two date objects. The result is a long integer which
    // is then printed.

  return 0;
}
</pre>

<h3>Private member functions.</h3>

<p>Just as it is possible (but not recommended) to have public data members, it is also possible
  to have private methods. The date class has <span class="code">is_leap</span>, <span
      class="code">month_length</span>, <span class="code">next</span>, and <span
      class="code">previous</span> methods that are private. These methods can only be called by
  other methods. They can't be used by users of date in general. They are helper methods that just
  make the job of implementing the public methods a bit easier. In a future version of date, with
  a different internal representation, these functions might no longer exist. Notice that <span
      class="code">is_leap</span> and <span class="code"
  >month_length</span> are constant methods. This is because they do not change the value stored
  in a date object.</p>

<h3>Information hiding revisited.</h3>

<p>The date implementation I've been talking about so far uses the obvious way of representing a
  date. Storing the day, month, and year separately makes it very easy to do I/O operations with
  humans since humans expect to see and use dates in that form. However, it is very awkward to do
  computations with dates in that form because of the pecularities of our calendar.</p>

<p>An alternative implementation for dates might look like this:</p>

<pre class="code">
class date {

  private:
    long JD_number;

  // etc...
};
</pre>

<p>Here instead of storing the day, month, and year separately I store a single julian day number.
  Every day in history has a unique julian day number (starting from an obscure date around 4700
  BCE). This approach makes computing with dates trivial. To find the number of days between two
  dates, simply subtract the julian day numbers. To advance a date by a given number of days,
  simply add the desired interval to the date's julian day number.</p>

<p>The down side of this implementation is that now I/O operations on dates are complicated.
  Humans don't normally want to see julian day numbers and so elaborate conversion functions are
  necessary to support the natural form of a date that humans expect.</p>

<p>The key point to realize is this: you can switch the internal representation of date from one
  form to another any time you want. You will need to rewrite all the class methods to take into
  account the new internal structure of the class, but programs that use the class will only need
  to be recompiled. In this case, switching from the obvious representation of dates to the julian
  day number representation makes the I/O methods harder (and slower) and the computational
  methods easier (and faster). Some methods that were inline will probably become non-inline while
  some methods that were not inline will probably become inline. This is all normal and
  reasonable. The clients of the date class do not need to know. This is an incredibly important
  capability.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<ol id="summary-list">

  <li>
    <p>Classes can define a special method with the same name as the class that is used to
      initialize objects of that class when they are declared. This method is called the
      constructor. By defining suitable constructors for your classes you can make sure that every
      object created is in a well defined state before it is used. This is a very powerful
      facility.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Although class methods are often defined in a separate .cpp file, it is possible to define
      them right in the class definition (in a header file). Such methods are said to be inline
      and the compiler should, in many cases, be able to replace calls to those methods with their
      bodies directly. In other words, calling an inline method is faster because no actual CALL
      instruction is generated by the compiler.</p>
    <p>It is also possible to explicitly declare a function to be inline using the <span
        class="code">inline</span> keyword.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>It is possible to define multiple functions or methods (including constructors) with the
      same name as long as the parameter lists for those functions or methods are sufficiently
      different. For example, you can declare two different print functions like this</p>
    <pre class="code">
void print(int);
void print(char *);
</pre>
    <p>The compiler figures out which one to call based on the argument types. Thus</p>
    <pre class="code">
print(10);       // Calls print(int)
print("Hello");  // Calls print(char *)
print(0);        // Ambiguous. Compile error.
                 //   The literal zero might be a null pointer.
</pre>
    <p>Note that overloaded functions are completely independent. They have the same name as each
      other but they do not need to do the same thing (to prevent confusion, all functions with
      the same name should probably have similar purposes).</p>
  </li>
