<h2>Body</h2>

<h3>What is operator overloading and why should we care about it?</h3>

<p>You have already seen operator overloading in some of my earlier examples. In this lesson I
  will describe this important C++ feature in more detail. Operator overloading allows you to
  define a meaning for the standard operators as they are applied to your own types. In this way,
  you can make your own types behave much more naturally than would otherwise be the case.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you wanted to create a type <span class="code">complex</span> to hold
  complex numbers. In fact, the standard library has such a type but let's ignore that for now. To
  create your own complex type you might start by creating a header file named complex.hpp like
  this</p>

<pre class="code">
namespace vtc {

  class complex {
    public:
      // We will fill in some operations shortly.

    private:
      double re, im;
  };
}
</pre>

<p>Here I'm using the rectangular representation of complex numbers (as a real part and an
  imaginary part). Alternative representations exist, but those issues aren't my primary concern
  right now.</p>

<p>Regardless of their internal representation, I would like to make complex numbers as easy and
  natural to use as possible. In particular, I would like to write things like this</p>

<pre class="code">
#include "complex.hpp"

int main()
{
  vtc::complex Z, X1, X2, X3, X4;

  std::cout &lt;&lt; "Enter four complex numbers: ";
  std::cin  &gt;&gt; X1 &gt;&gt; X2 &gt;&gt; X3 &gt;&gt; X4;

  Z = (X1 + X2) / (X1 - X2);
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "The result is: " &lt;&lt; Z &lt;&lt; "\n";
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>Since complex numbers are numbers, I should be able to apply the usual numeric operations on
  them just the way I can with integers. Also I should be able to do I/O with complex numbers
  using inserter and extractor operators. In a language without operator overloading (such as C)
  all operations would have to be implemented with normal functions. In that case I would have to
  write things like</p>

<pre class="code">
Z = complex_divide(complex_add(X1, X2), complex_subtract(X1, X2));
</pre>

<p>That is not nearly as nice. It also significantly restricts what I can accomplish with my user
  defined type. By making complex numbers seem like "just another number" it is possible to create
  <i>generic</i> algorithms using a C++ feature called templates (which I will introduce in a
  later lesson) that apply not only to the built in types, but also to appropriate user-defined
  types with the necessary overloaded operators.</p>

<h3>Okay, so how does it work?</h3>

<p>To overload an operator, you only need to write a function with a special name. For example,
  here is how I might create an overloaded version of <span class="code">+</span> that knows how
  to add complex numbers.</p>

<pre class="code">
namespace vtc {

  complex operator+(const complex &amp;left, const complex &amp;right)
  {
    complex result;

    result.re = left.re + right.re;
    result.im = left.im + right.im;
    return result;
  }

}
</pre>

<p>This function is perfectly ordinary looking except for the funny name: <span class="code"
>operator+</span>. This special name tells the compiler that this function is to be invoked
  whenever you try to use <span class="code">+</span> with complex numbers. An expression like
  <span class="code">Z = X1 + X2</span> is really <span class="code">Z =
        operator+(X1, X2)</span>. In fact, you could even write it that way if you wanted.</p>

<p>Note that in my example above, the operator function is not a method of the class. Thus in
  order to have access to the class's private section it would need to be declared as a <i>friend
    function</i> in the header file.</p>

<pre class="code">
namespace vtc {

   class complex {
     friend complex operator+(const complex &amp;left, const complex &amp;right);

     public:
       // Public methods.

     private:
       double re, im;
   };

}
</pre>

<p>Friend functions are ordinary functions that have direct access to the private section of the
  class that declares them as friends. In terms of access control, they are similar to methods.
  However, unlike a method a friend function has no implicit object that it is working on. All
  objects must be passed to the friend in other ways (for example, as parameters).</p>

<p>Notice how I didn't have to put a namespace qualifer on <span class="code"
>operator+</span> when I used it? For example when I just did <span class="code">Z = X1
        + X2</span> how did the compiler know to look in namespace <span class="code">vtc</span>
  for the <span class="code">operator+</span> I'm trying to use? C++ has a special rule that it
  uses in a case like this. If it can't locate an appropriate operator function any other way, it
  will search in the namespaces where the types of the operator's arguments are located. In the
  example above <span class="code">X1</span> and <span class="code"
  >X2</span> are both of type <span class="code">vtc::complex</span>. Thus the compiler will know
  to look in the <span class="code">vtc</span> namespace for an appropriate <span
      class="code">operator+</span>. This rule is technically called <i>argument dependent
    lookup</i>, but most people refer to it as "Koenig lookup" (after Andrew Koenig, who first
  proposed the feature). It is essential for operator overloading to work smoothly with
  namespaces.</p>

<p>Here are some restrictions that apply when you are overloading operators.</p>

<ol>

  <li>
    <p>An operator function must have a user defined type or a reference to a user defined type as
      at least one of its parameters. Alternatively, operator functions can be class methods. It
      is also possible to overload operators that have enumeration types for their parameters.</p>
    <p>This rules out redefining operators that operate exclusively on the built in types or
      pointers types. For example, you can't redefine the meaning of <span class="code"
      >+</span> as applied to integers.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>You cannot introduce operators. You can only overload operators native to C++, and of those
      you cannot overload <span class="code">.</span>, <span class="code">::</span>, <span
          class="code">?:</span>, and <span class="code">.*</span>.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>You cannot change an operator's precedence or associativity.</p>
  </li>

</ol>

<p>On the other hand, operator overloading lifts several restrictions normally present on the
  operators. In general, operator functions have all the capabilities of ordinary functions.</p>

<ol>

  <li>
    <p>As long as one parameter is of class (or enumeration) type, the other parameter, if
      present, can be of any type at all. In fact, you can overload operator functions on
      parameter types just like ordinary functions.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Operator functions can return any type at all.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Operator functions can accept non lvalue arguments and return lvalues (by returning a
      reference) even if the original operators could not. For example a statement like</p>
    <pre class="code">
A + B = C;     // operator+ returns a reference.
</pre>
    <p>might be legal when you use overloaded operators. This example is strange, but the ability
      for an operator function to return a reference is very important. I will show useful
      examples of that in later lessons.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>You do not need to maintain relationships between operators. For example</p>
    <pre class="code">
A  = A + 1;  // Probably A = operator+(A, 1);
A += 1;      // Probably A.operator+=(1);
++A;         // Probably A.operator++();
</pre>
    <p>are all handled with independent operator functions. Of course, to prevent surprises, you
      should provide the same semantics for all three expressions.</p>
    <p>It may be possible, however, to overload operators so <span class="code">++A</span> is
      significantly more efficient than the long winded <span class="code">A = A +
            1</span>. If <span class="code">A</span> were of type int, modern compilers would
      probably handle all three of the above statements the same way. For an elaborate user
      defined type, however, you may want to overload <span class="code">operator+</span>, <span
          class="code">operator+=</span>, and <span class="code">operator++</span> separately for
      efficiency reasons.</p>
  </li>

</ol>

<p>In general you should only overload operators to do what one would naturally expect. Don't
  overload <span class="code">-</span> to do addition, or <span class="code">*</span> to do
  subtraction! Operator overloading is a powerful feature, but it is easily abused. Some
  programmers overload operators much too aggressively. If it is not totally clear that an
  overloaded operator is appropriate, it probably isn't appropriate.</p>

<h3>Method vs non-method vs friend functions.</h3>

<p>You can create operator functions that are mehods, non-methods, or friends. What are the
  differences? When an operator function is a class mehod, one of its arguments is the implicit
  object against which it is invoked. For example, suppose I wanted to make an overloaded <span
      class="code">+</span> operator for complex that was a class method. In the header file I
  would do</p>

<pre class="code">
namespace vtc {

   class complex {
     public:
       complex operator+(const complex &amp;right);
         // I show only one parameter. The other parameter is the implicit object.

     private:
       // etc...
   };
}
</pre>

<p>To use this operator I might do</p>

<pre class="code">
int main()
{
  vtc::complex Z, X1, X2;

  Z = X1 + X2;  // Really Z = X1.operator+(X2);

  // etc...
}
</pre>

<p>The left operand is the object against which the method is applied. The right operand is
  explicit. The asymmetry is a little strange for a case like <span class="code">+</span> since
  <span class="code">+</span> is inherently symmetrical in its action. However, some operators are
  asymmetrical anyway (such as <span class="code">+=</span>) and are more natural as methods. Also
  unary operators are often more natural as methods. Here is an example of that</p>

<pre class="code">
namespace vtc {

  class complex {
    public:
      complex operator-();
        // Unary minus (used to negate a complex number) takes no
        // parameters when declared as a method. It operates on the
        // implicit object.

    private:
      // etc...
  };
}

int main()
{
  vtc::complex Z, X1;

  Z = -X1; // Really Z = X1.operator-();

  // etc...
}
</pre>

<p>Symmetric binary operators like <span class="code">+</span> are usually more naturally defined
  as non-method functions. This is what I did in my earlier examples. However, non-method
  functions have no special access to the private section of the class. In some cases, this is
  fine. If the operator function can be written efficiently without such access, then there is no
  point in giving it such access. In many cases, though, the operator function will need access to
  the private section. Thus declaring non-method operator functions to be friends often makes
  sense.</p>

<h3>The value of references and const.</h3>

<p>Now is the time for me to describe why references and const are important in C++. Notice how in
  my examples above I declared my overloaded addition operator to take references to const
  complex. What if I tried to use pointers to complex numbers instead?</p>

<pre class="code">
namespace vtc {

  complex operator+(complex *left, complex *right)
  {
    complex result;

    result.re = left->re + right->re;
    result.im = left->im + right->im;
    return result;
  }

}
</pre>

<p>Here I'm using the <span class="code">-></span> operator to access the members of the objects
  pointed at by left and right. That is not a problem. The problem is: how would I use this
  function?</p>

<pre class="code">
Z = X1 + Z2;
</pre>

<p>This doesn't work. My <span class="code">operator+</span> requires pointers.</p>

<pre class="code">
Z = &amp;X1 + &amp;X2;
</pre>

<p>This doesn't really work either. I'm trying to add two pointers here, not two <span
    class="code">vtc::complex</span> objects. I can't overload operators on just pointers (see the
  list of restrictions above) so the whole idea of using pointers is ill-founded. Even if it were
  legal, the requirement of putting <span class="code">&amp;</span> in front of <span
      class="code">X1</span> and <span class="code">X2</span> above is pretty unacceptable.</p>

<p>Of course I could write my operator function to take its parameters by value like this</p>

<pre class="code">
namespace vtc {

  complex operator+(complex left, complex right)
  {
    complex result;

    result.re = left.re + right.re;
    result.im = left.im + right.im;
    return result;
  }

}
</pre>

<p>The problem with this is that it requires that my complex objects get copied every time an
  operator function is called. For a relatively small object like complex (it only contains two
  doubles as members) that requirement might not be too bad. But for a large object, the time
  spent copying it would be unacceptable. The only proper solution is to define my operator
  functions to take references.</p>

<p>Now, why is the const necessary? Remember in an earlier lesson when I said the compiler won't
  bind a non-const reference argument to a literal number? Here is that example again</p>

<pre class="code">
void f(int &amp;);
  // Function f takes a reference to a (non-const) int.

int main()
{
  f(100);  // Error!
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>The idea here is that function <span class="code">f</span> might try to modify the object
  referred to by its parameter and modifying a literal number just doesn't make sense. Now, with
  that in mind, take another look at this expression involving my complex type</p>

<pre class="code">
Z = (X1 + X2) / (X1 - X2);
</pre>

<p>What are the operands to the <span class="code">operator/</span> function? The left operand is
  the output of the <span class="code">operator+</span> function and the right operand is the
  output of the <span class="code">operator-</span> function. The objects returned by those two
  functions are anonymous temporary objects. They were not explicitly declared by me, yet they
  must be set up and managed by the compiler in order for the expression to work. If the <span
      class="code">operator/</span> function took references to non-const, the compiler would
  assume that the function was going to try and modify the anonymous temporaries. That really
  doesn't make any sense (and it makes it difficult for the compiler to manage those temporaries
  intelligently). As a result, the compiler would just not allow the expression above to be
  written. It would be an error.</p>

<p>Thus to allow elaborate, nested expressions using overloaded operators, you must be sure to
  declare the parameters of your operator functions as taking references to const. If you leave
  out the const, you won't be able to use your operators in a natural way.</p>

<h3>Don't return references.</h3>

<p>Although you normally do want references (to const) as the parameters of your overloaded
  functions, you normally do <em>not</em> want to return a reference. Instead you usually want to
  return a whole object. It is true that returning whole objects might be sluggish when the
  objects are large, but if you try to do otherwise subtle errors will creep into your program.
  Suppose you tried to write <span class="code">operator+</span> for complex like this:</p>

<pre class="code">
namespace vtc {

  complex &amp;operator+(const complex &amp;left, const complex &amp;right)
  {
    static complex result;
      // This has to be static or it will just vanish when the function returns.

    result.re = left.re + right.re;
    result.im = left.im + right.im;
    return result;
      // This really just returns a reference to result. The result is not copied.
  }

}
</pre>

<p>This looks great. But look again. What happens when you do</p>

<pre class="code">
Z = (X1 + X2) / (X3 + X4);
</pre>

<p>When you first compute <span class="code">X1 + X2</span> the result is left in a static local
  object in the <span class="code">operator+</span> function. Then when you compute <span
      class="code">X3 + X4</span>, the new result overwrites the old one. By the time <span
      class="code">operator/</span> is called, it will get two references to the latest sum.</p>

<p>In general, to properly evaluate some expressions, objects must occasionally be copied into
  temporaries. This is just the way it is. If you try to fight that by creating operator functions
  that return references instead of whole objects, you are flirting with disaster. Don't do
  it.</p>

<h3>I/O operations.</h3>

<p>You can use operator overloading to create your own inserter and extractor operators. Here is
  how to make an operator&lt;&lt; for complex numbers.</p>

<pre class="code">
namespace vtc {

  std::ostream &amp;operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream &amp;os, const complex &amp;right)
  {
    os &lt;&lt; "(" &lt;&lt; right.re &lt;&lt; ", " &lt;&lt; right.im &lt;&lt; ")";
    return os;
  }
}
</pre>

<p>With this function you can say</p>

<pre class="code">
int main()
{
  vtc::complex number;

  // Put a value into number.

  std::cout &lt;&lt; "The answer is: " &lt;&lt; number &lt;&lt; "\n";
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>The function defines a new operator&lt;&lt; that takes a reference to a <span
    class="code">std::ostream</span> on the left and a reference to a (const) <span
    class="code">complex</span> on the right. It then uses the standard <span class="code"
>ostream</span> inserter operators to output the components of the <span class="code"
>complex</span> in some suitable way. Finally it returns the reference to the <span
    class="code">ostream</span>. This allows the <span class="code">&lt;&lt;</span> operator to be
  chained so that any further applications of it will be applied to the same <span
      class="code">ostream</span> (as in the way the "\n" is printed in my example above). An
  extractor operator can be created similarly. In this way you can arrange to do I/O on your own
  types as naturally as with the built-in types.</p>

<p>Notice how this operator function <em>does</em> return a reference. You might wonder what's up
  with that. Just a few paragraphs earlier, I talked about how returning a reference from an
  operator function was a bad idea. But this is a different case. Here I'm returning the same
  reference I've been given in order to "pass it on". The real object is located somewhere else.
  There is no need to create a temporary here. The I/O operators are a bit unusual in this respect
  as compared to most overloaded operators.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<ol id="summary-list">

  <li>
    <p>C++ supports operators overloading. This allows you to define your own functions that will
      be used whenever someone uses a standard operator with an object of class type. Most
      operators can be overloaded but there are some restrictions. At least one of the operator's
      arguments must be of class type (or enumeration type), new operators can't be introduced,
      and the assocation and precedence of existing operators can't be changed. However, operator
      functions are otherwise completely general; they can do whatever you like.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Overloaded operators can be class methods, ordinary functions, or friend functions. As
      class methods, their first (left) parameter is always the object they are invoked against.
      Friend functions are ordinary functions that have access to a class's private section. Often
      symmetric, binary operators are implemented as friends.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>When overloading operators it is usual to take parameters by reference but to return the
      result by value. Reference parameters are usually faster because they don't involve copying
      the operands. However, returning by reference is dangerous because, in general, it isn't
      possible to allocate the memory for the return value properly.</p>
  </li>
