  <li>
    <p>Overloading <span class="code">operator[]</span></p>

    <p>Overloading <span class="code">operator-></span></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Overloading <span class="code">operator()</span></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><span class="code">operator++()</span> vs <span class="code"

<h2>Body</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This lesson contains some additional details on operator overloading. The material in this
  lesson is of a somewhat advanced nature; it would be reasonable for you to skip this lesson on a
  first reading and return to it when you are further along in your study. However, the techniques
  I cover here are essential for advanced C++ libraries, such as the Standard Template Library
  (STL). I feel it is important to discuss them at this stage so that you are better able to
  understand what the STL is doing when I introduce it in a later lesson.</p>
