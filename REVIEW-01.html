<h3>The anatomy of a function</h3>

<p>In C, the basic unit of code is the function. The program starts by executing function main and
  ends when main returns. In the course of executing main, many other functions normally get
  called directly or indirectly. Writing a program in C is about writing functions.</p>

<p>You can think of a function as a box. It takes inputs, processes them, and produces an output.
  The inputs are the parameters and the output is the return value. Many functions produce other
  side effects as they process their parameters. In some cases the side effects are the main
  reason the function is used. Here is a picture that illustrates the ideas:</p>

<pre class="figure">
                    +----------+
     x   ----->     |          |
                    |          |
     y   ----->     |  func()  |     -----> result
                    |          |
     x   ----->     |          |
                    +----------+
</pre>

<p>This function, named <span class="code">func</span>, is shown taking three parameters and
  returning a result. In addition to computing the result, <span class="code">func</span> may also
  do other side effects such as writing to a log file or printing some text on the display. When a
  function is documented, the nature and meaning of the parameters and the result must be
  documented. Furthermore the side effects caused by the function and any precondition the
  function requires must also be documented. A precondition is something that must be true before
  the function can be legitimately called. Without all of this information being available and
  understood by the programmer, the function can't be used correctly.</p>

<p>Exactly how a function does its work internally is of no interest to the programmer who uses
  it. Exactly when and where a function will be used is of no interest to the programmer who
  writes it. Both rely on the documented description of what the function requires and what it
  does (called the function's interface) to understand how to work with the function. Functions
  thus allow two separate programmers to work together without even knowing each other. This is
  very important.</p>

<p>Let me show you a few examples to make things a bit more concrete. The function <span
    class="code">sqrt</span> in the standard library (declared in math.h) computes the square root
  of its parameter. It might be used like this:</p>

<pre class="code">
  #include &lt;math.h&gt;
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

  int main( void )
  {
      double result;

      result = sqrt( 2.0 );
      printf( "The square root of 2 is: %f\n", result );
      return 0;
  }
</pre>

<p>Here I'm sending the value 2.0 into the function and putting what the function returns into the
  variable <span class="code">result</span>. This function has no external side effects, but it
  does have the precondition that the value it is given be non-negative. You can't use <span
      class="code">sqrt</span> to compute the square root of a negative number.</p>

<p>My example also uses function <span class="code">printf</span>. The <span
    class="code">printf</span> function takes several parameters and returns an integer. In
  particular, it returns the number of characters it actually prints. Normally people don't care
  about this and, in fact, I'm ignoring the value returned by <span
      class="code">printf</span> in my example above. Instead <span class="code">printf</span> is
  usually called because of its very useful side effect: it causes things to be printed on the
  terminal. The <span class="code">printf</span> function's first parameter is complicated. It is
  a string containing special formatting characters that describe what is to be printed and how.
  All of this is described in <span class="code">printf</span>'s documentation.</p>

<p>In both cases above, <span class="code">sqrt</span> and <span class="code">printf</span>, the
  user of the functions does not need to worry about exactly how the functions work. All the user
  needs to know is what they do and how to get them to do it. The people who wrote the functions
  need to worry about how to make them work, but don't need to think about the program in which
  they will be used. This is the essential separation of concerns that I talked about earlier.</p>

<p>When you write a function, you must write both the header and the body. The header contains the
  function's name, return type, and information about the function's parameters. Here is an
  example:</p>

<pre class="code">
  int count_items(char *buffer, char ch)
  {
      ...
  }
</pre>

<p>The return type is show first. In the example above it is <span class="code">int</span>. Next
  comes the function's name and then, in parentheses, information about the parameters. The only
  information the compiler needs to know is the number of parameters, their types, and what names
  I want to use for them in the function's body. This particular function takes two parameters,
  the first of which is called <span class="code">buffer</span> and is of type pointer to
  character, and the second of which is called <span class="code">ch</span> and is of type
  character.</p>

<p>Before this function can be used or written, however, the programmers must know what it does.
  Thus every function must be accompanied by appropriate documentation that describes it. A more
  correct header for this function is:</p>

<pre class="code">
  /*
   * Scans the null terminated string pointed at by buffer and counts the
   * number of times the character ch is found in that string. It returns
   * the resulting count.
   *
   */
  int count_items( char *buffer, char ch )
  {
      ...
  }
</pre>

<p>It is important to understand that without documentation a function is incomplete. The
  programmers who use a function need to know more about it than the compiler does. Thus even
  though the compiler ignores the documentation, it is still a necessary part of the function.</p>

<p>The parameters to the function, <span class="code">buffer</span> and <span
    class="code">ch</span> in my example above, are generic placeholders. When the function is
  used, the actual data given to it will be something the caller will provide. The person who
  defines the function does not know what that data will be. This is normal.</p>

<p>The function definition contains the header as I've described so far and a body inside of
  braces. It is in the body that the action of the function is specified. Here is how <span
      class="code">count_items</span> might look:</p>

<pre class="code">
  int count_items( char *buffer, char ch )
  {
      int count = 0;

      while( *buffer ) {
          if( *buffer == ch ) count++;
          buffer++;
      }
      return count;
  }
</pre>

<p>This function works by stepping the given pointer down the string until the null byte (which
  will test as false) is found. For each character in the string, that character is compared
  against <span class="code">ch</span>. If it is a match a counter is incremented. When the entire
  string has been scanned, the final count is returned. If it happens that the given pointer is
  initially pointing at the null character, a count of zero will be properly returned.</p>

<p>I was able to write this function with no knowledge whatsoever of where it will be used. I
  can't emphasize too much how important that is.</p>

<h3>Declaring functions</h3>

<p>What I wrote for <span class="code">count_items</span> above is called a definition. It resides
  in a .c file. Before a function can be used, however, the compiler should first pass over a
  declaration of that function. A declaration is just the header of the function without the body.
  The header is terminated with a semicolon (instead of moving right into an open brace). Here is
  a declaration for <span class="code">count_items</span>:</p>

<pre class="code">
  int count_items( char *buffer, char ch );
</pre>

<p>This declaration merely informs the compiler that this function exists someplace and allows the
  compiler to process calls to the function. The declaration does not, by itself, cause the
  function to become part of your program.</p>

<p>Actually in a function declaration, the names of the parameters are not significant in any way.
  They are ignored by the compiler and can be left out. Some programmers would write the
  declaration of <span class="code">count_items</span> like this:</p>

<pre class="code">
  int count_items( char *, char );
</pre>

<p>Other programmers prefer to keep the names in the declaration because they help to document the
  function. It is a matter of style.</p>

<p>Function declarations are typically put in header files so that they can be easily #included
  into various programs. This is how the standard library is managed and most programmers do the
  same thing with their own functions as well. When you #include stdio.h you are only showing the
  compiler declarations of the various I/O functions. The actual function definitions are
  elsewhere.</p>

<h3>Using functions</h3>

<p>When a function is invoked, we say that it is called. To call a function, you must provide that
  function with appropriate arguments (and satisfy any preconditions that the function requires).
  Here is an example of how <span class="code">count_items</span> might be called:</p>

<pre class="code">
  // Show the compiler the declarations of printf and strcpy.
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  #include &lt;string.h&gt;

  // Declaration allows compiler to process call properly.
  // This would normally be in a header file.
  int count_items( char *, char );

  int main( void )
  {
      char name[128];
      int  e_count;

      strcpy( name, "Peter C. Chapin" );
      e_count = count_items( name, 'e' );

      printf( "There are %d 'e' characters in the string.\n", e_count );
      return 0;
  }
</pre>

<p>When a function is called the values given to it are called the arguments to the function. In
  the example above, I provide <span class="code">name</span> and <span
      class="code">'e'</span> as arguments to <span class="code">count_items</span>. Recall that
  in C, the name of an array without an index is taken to be the address of the array's first
  element. Thus <span class="code">name</span> is a pointer to the first character in the name
  array.</p>

<p>When a function is called the arguments are <em>copied</em> into the function's parameters. The
  value of the pointer <span class="code">name</span> is copied into the parameter <span
      class="code">buffer</span>, and the value of <span class="code">'e'</span> is copied into
  the parameter <span class="code">ch</span>. The function then executes. The value the function
  returns (called <span class="code">result</span> in this function) replaces the function call in
  whatever expression the function call is in. Here, that value is just used to assign to <span
      class="code">e_count</span>.</p>

<p>It is very important to understand that functions get copies of their arguments. The function
  can modify its copy (the parameter) without changing the original argument. This is called pass
  by value and it is the only way functions in C work. Other languages have other ways of doing
  this, but not C. (In C++ you can pass a reference and allow the function to modify the original
  argument).</p>

<p>Notice how I distinguish between argument and parameter. When a function is called the
  arguments are copied into the parameters. The function then works with the parameters. This
  distinction is subtle but important.</p>

<p>Notice also how I am able to use <span class="code">count_items</span> without any particular
  knowledge of how it works internally. This is also very important.</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>

<p>In order to create <span class="code">count_items</span>, or any function, without any
  knowledge of how it will be used, it is important that variables declared inside the function be
  local to the function. Here is <span class="code">count_items</span> again:</p>

<pre class="code">
  int count_items( char *buffer, char ch )
  {
      int count = 0;

      while( *buffer ) {
          if( *buffer == ch ) count++;
          buffer++;
      }
      return count;
  }
</pre>

<p>The variable <span class="code">count</span> is a local variable. It only exists while <span
    class="code">count_items</span> is running. When <span class="code"
>count_items</span> returns that variable will cease to exist. Furthermore any use of <span
    class="code">count</span> inside of <span class="code">count_items</span> will refer to the
  local variable. If a variable named <span class="code">count</span> exists outside the function,
  it will be temporarily hidden.</p>

<p>In this way the programmer who creates <span class="code">count_items</span> can choose
  whatever variable names he/she likes without worrying about how they might conflict with
  variable names chosen elsewhere in the program. Without this facility, constructing large
  programs would be nearly impossible to do correctly.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<ol id="summary-list">
  <li><p>A function is a body of code that performs a particular task. Functions take inputs,
    called parameters, and produce a single result. In addition many functions have side effects.
    In some cases, the function exists entirely for its side effects. Function definitions consist
    of a header that specifies the function's return type, name, parameters, and an attached body
    that specifies the action of the function. Function definitions are normally placed in .c
    files.</p></li>

  <li><p>A function declaration is just the function header followed by a semicolon. The names of
    the parameters are optional in a function declaration and are often left out. Function
    declarations are normally placed in header files.</p></li>

  <li><p>When a function is called its arguments are copied into its parameters. The value the
    function returns is used to replace the call in whatever expression the call is in.</p></li>

  <li><p>Variables declared inside the function are local to that function. They hid any similarly
    named variables outside the function. Such variables also (normally) only last as long as the
    function lasts.</p></li>
