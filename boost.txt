Set Up Boost
============

This document describes the way in which I prepared the Boost archive for use in VTC's Parallel
Programming class. It contains specific instructions for compiling the Boost thread libraries in
both 32 bit and 64 bit form.

YOU PROBABLY DON'T NEED TO READ THIS! I can provide a Boost distribution that contains the
necessary libraries pre-compiled. This document is a log of what I did. It will be useful in
case you (or I) need to do it again.

These instructions pertain to Windows, but the instructions for compiling Boost on Linux are
similar.

Install Boost.
  1. Unpack the 7z file containing the source code to some suitable location.
  2. Create a BOOST_HOME environment variable that points to the top level folder.
  
Build b2/bjam.
  1. Open a "Developer Command Prompt for VS2013" window.
  2. cd into %BOOST_HOME%\tools\build\v2
  3. Execute: .\bootstrap.bat. No arguments are necessary.
  4. Execute: .\b2 install --prefix=PREFIX. Here PREFIX is the directory to install b2.
     It should be on the path.
  
Build Boost libraries for Microsoft Visual C++:
  1. Open a "Developer Command Prompt for VS2013" window.
  2. cd to %BOOST_HOME% 
  3. Execute: b2 address-model=32 toolset=msvc --build-type=complete stage
  4. Create a folder %BOOST_HOME%\lib\32. Move everything from 'stage' into that folder.
  5. Remove the now empty 'stage' folder.
  
  1. Open a "VS2013 x64 Cross Tools Command Prompt" window.
  2. cd to %BOOST_HOME%
  3. Execute: b2 address-model=64 toolset=msvc --build-type=complete stage
  4. Create a folder %BOOST_HOME%\lib\64. Move everything from 'stage' into that folder.
  5. Remove the now empty 'stage' folder.

Build Boost libraries for Intel C++:
  1. Open a "Intel Parallel Studio XE 2013 IA-32 Visual Studio 2013" window.
  2. cd to %BOOST_HOME%
  3. Execute: b2 address-model=32 toolset=intel --build-type=complete stage

  1. Open a "Intel Parallel Studio XE 2013 Intel 64 Visual Studio 2013" window.
  2. cd to %BOOST_HOME%
  3. Execute: b2 address-model=64 toolset=intel --build-type=complete stage

Remove the bin.v2 folder.
