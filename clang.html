<h1>Installing clang++ from Source</h1>

<p>This document describes how to install clang++ from source. The full details are in the <a
    href="http://llvm.org/docs/">LLVM documentation</a> (look, in particular, at the <a
    href="http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html"><i>Getting Started with the LLVM
  System</i></a> document). The purpose of this document is to distill that information into a
  short, easily digestible form.</p>

<p>This document assumes you are using a Linux or some other Unix-like system. Please refer to the
  official documentation above if you want to install clang++ on Windows. Follow the steps
  below.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>LLVM and clang++ are written in C++, and you'll need a C++ compiler to bootstrap them.
    Normally you would use g++. Use the command</p>
    <pre>
        $ which g++
    </pre>
    <p>to see if you have g++ installed. If you see no output you'll need to install <tt>g++</tt>
      using your system's package manager.</p></li>

  <li><p>Download LLVM from the official <a href="http://llvm.org/releases/">LLVM Releases</a> web
    page. At the time of this writing, the most recent version of the system is version 3.3. You
    need three components: Clang source code, LLVM source code, and Compiler RT source code.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Unpack the LLVM source code in some suitable place. It should create a directory named
    something like <tt>llvm-3.3.src</tt>.</p></li>

  <li><p>Unpack the Clang source code and move the directory created into
    <tt>llvm-3.3.src/tools</tt>. Rename the directory to just <tt>clang</tt> (take away any
    version number, etc).</p></li>

  <li><p>Unpack the Compiler RT source code and move the directory created into <tt>llvm-3.3.src/projects</tt>.
    Rename the directory to just <tt>compiler-rt</tt> (take away any version number, etc). This
    step and the previous step put these auxiliary projects into a location where they will be
    automatically found and built by the main LLVM build system.</p></li>

  <li><p>Create a directory to hold the result of the build. I suggest <tt>llvm-3.3.bld</tt> as a
    sibling of <tt>llvm-3.3.src</tt>. All build artifacts will be put into this directory leaving
    the source directory in a pristine state.</p></li>

  <li><p>Change into your build directory and do</p>
    <pre>
        $ ../llvm-3.3.src/configure --prefix=path/to/installation
      </pre>
    <p>Replace <tt>path/to/installation</tt> with the location where you would like the system
      ultimately to be installed. If you leave off the <tt>--prefix</tt> option it will default to
      <tt>/usr/local</tt>. Often this is fine but you may wish to install the system somewhere
      under your home directory instead (for example). In any case be sure the <tt>bin</tt>
      directory beneath the installation prefix is on your PATH. If this is not the case you won't
      be able to execute the programs once they are installed.</p></li>

  <li><p>when <tt>configure</tt> completes run <tt>make</tt> in the build directory to compile
    everything. If you have a multicore processor, you can speed up the build by running parallel
    instances of the compiler. Use</p>
    <pre>
        $ make -j n
      </pre>
    <p>where <tt>n</tt> is the number of parallel instances to run (try using the number of cores
      you have). Fully building everything takes a long time.</p></li>

  <li><p>Once the system has finished building run <tt>make check</tt> to run the LLVM unit tests.
    This will give you some confidence that it built correctly. Note that this only tests the LLVM
    infrastructure. This step does not test the clang compiler.</p></li>

  <li><p>Run <tt>make install</tt> to install everything to the location you specified previously
    with the <tt>--prefix</tt> option. You may need to become root to do this step depending on
    where you are installing the system (if you are installing to your home directory, you can do
    everything under your normal user account). You are now ready to program using LLVM and clang!
