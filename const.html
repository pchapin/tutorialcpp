<h1 style="text-align:center;">const</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In C++ const is very important. Some features connected with operator overloading only work
  when objects are treated as constants. The compiler is quite fussy about const since violations
  of constantness can cause for strange effects in otherwise normal looking programs. While the
  language allows you to declare constant objects, the real usefulness of const is in the way it
  supports the rest of the language.</p>

<p>The main point to remember is this: If T is some type, then It is not possible to put a pointer
  to const T into an object of type pointer to T. However, it <em>is</em> possible to put a
  pointer to T into an object of type pointer to const T. Thus:</p>

<pre>
      int X;
const int Y = 10; // const objects must be initialized.

      int *pi;
const int *pci;   // pci points at a const. It is not const itself.

 pi = &amp;X:  // Fine.
 pi = &amp;Y;  // Error. Can't put pointer to const into "normal" pointer.
pci = &amp;X;  // Fine. Can no longer modify X via *pci. So what?
pci = &amp;Y;  // Fine. Types match.
</pre>

<p>This whole issue is much more important when functions are involved. If a function is taking a
  pointer parameter and does not modify the thing pointed at by that parameter, then you should
  declare the function to take a pointer to const. Consider</p>

<pre>
int strlen(char *p)
{
  char *start = p;

  while (*p != '\0') p++;
  return p - start;
}
</pre>

<p>This function can't be called to measure the length of a string of constant characters. Such a
  string has a pointer to const char as its address. The compiler believes this function
  <em>might</em> be modifying the characters pointed at by p and thus won't allow it to be used on
  a string of constant characters. Better is</p>

<pre>
int strlen(const char *p)
{
  char *start = p;

  while (*p != '\0') p++;
  return (p - start);
}
</pre>

<p>By declaring the parameter to be a pointer to const we are promising the compiler that we won't
  modify the characters pointed at by that pointer. We can now apply strlen() to a string of
  constant characters. Normal, non-constant characters will still work, however, because it's okay
  to put a pointer to char into something of type pointer to const char.</p>

<p>The function above won't compile. Do you see why? The problem is the line</p>

<pre>
char *start = p;
</pre>

<p>Now that p is a pointer to const character, we have to change that line to</p>

<pre>
const char *start = p;
</pre>

<p>It's often difficult to add const after the fact because when you add const to one place you
  end up having to add it to a bunch of other places. This is informally called "const chasing"
  and it's a big pain. The solution is to use const consistently from the start. If you do that
  you won't have to const chase and you won't get any bothersome surprises from the compiler when
  you start to play with features like operator overloading and the like.</p>

<p>It is also possible to have references to const. Here is a silly version of the swap function I
  mentioned in class</p>

<pre>
void swap(const int &amp;left, const int &amp;right)
{
  int temp = left;  // Ok. Just reading the const.
  left  = right;    // Error! Can't write into left. It's const.
  right = temp;     // Error! Can't write into right. It's const.
}
</pre>

<p>A real swap function needs to be able to modify the objects referenced by it's parameters thus
  it's inappropriate to declared them to be references to const. However in other cases it's very
  appropriate to declare references to const.</p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<p>1. Given the declarations below, which of the statements below that are errors?</p>

<pre>
      char  first[] = "Peter";
const char  last[]  = "Chapin";
      char *p;
const char *pc;
      char * const c1 = first;  // The pointer is const.
const char * const c2 = last;   // What does this mean?

 p = first;
 p = last;
pc = first;
pc = last;
c1 = first;
c2 = last;

 p = pc;
pc = p;
 p = c1;
 p = c2;
pc = c1;
pc = c2;

 *p = 'X';
*pc = 'X';
*c1 = 'X';
*c2 = 'X';
</pre>
