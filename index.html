<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The documents linked to this page constitute the "lectures" of a one-semester course in the C++
  programming language (primarily the 1998 standard). I created these documents myself and have
  used them in programming classes at <a href="http://www.vermontstate.edu/">Vermont State
    University</a>, where I am an instructor. I am posting these documents on the web for public
  access under the terms of the <a href="GFDL.txt">GNU Free Documentation License</a> (GFDL).</p>

<h2>Lessons</h2>

<p>This course assumes as a prerequisite that you are familiar with C. Teaching C++ on top of a C
  background is controversial. Some C++ instructors believe that C++ is best taught on its own
  terms and not as an enhancement to C. Such an approach makes sense because C++ offers different
  (and better) ways of handling certain problems as compared to C. It can take a while for a
  seasoned C programmer to break old habits and really start using C++ to its full potential.
  However, at Vermont State University we teach plain C in an introductory course because we
  believe there are still many contexts where plain C is all that is available and thus worth
  learning for its own sake. As a result, our C++ course assumes a C background.</p>

<p>C++ is an enormous language that can be used in many ways. It would be impossible for a single
  course to cover all of what is C++. In this course, I focus on C++'s support for user-defined
  types and object-oriented programming. These are important facilities that are in wide use.
  However, there are many C++ features that I do not describe in detail here. In particular, this
  course is light on templates and generic programming. It is my hope, however, that after working
  through the lessons in this course, you will be in a good position to study C++ templates from
  other sources.</p>

<p>I have broken all of this material into 30 lessons along with some supporting files. Each
  lesson builds on the previous lessons. I recommend that you read the lessons in order. However,
  if you have some previous C++ experience, you may find it useful to skip around. In places where
  it matters, which are few, this course assumes you are using the g++ compiler on a Unix system.
  In addition, this course assumes you are comfortable editing source code files with a good
  programmer's editor.</p>

<p>In addition to the lessons themselves, I have also prepared several example programs to help
  illustrate some points and to show the features of C++ in a more realistic way. In the list
  below, I show links to these examples as well as to the lesson text. Each example is associated
  with a particular lesson. You should review an example after you've read the corresponding
  lesson.</p>

<p>I have also created three review lessons that highlight essential topics from C that you need
  to know before you'll be able to make sense of the materials in this course. These three review
  lessons are shown below just before the main list of lessons for this course. If you are
  interested in my full C course, see the links at the bottom of this page.</p>

<p>Finally, I have prepared a couple of supplementary lessons on using the <kbd>gdb</kbd> debugger
  and the <kbd>Emacs</kbd> text editor. These lessons are not about C++ directly, but may be of
  interest if you are using those tools. The supplementary lessons are at the bottom of the
  numbered lesson list.</p>

</ul>

<hr/>
<h2>Links</h2>

<p>The following links provide access to potentially useful resources about C++.</p>

<h3>Compilers</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Here is Microsoft's page about <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio</a>,
    and the official <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudio/">Visual Studio blog</a>.</li>

  <li>The <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">Gcc home page</a> contains all the latest about the Gnu
    Compiler Collection.</li>

  <li>The official websites of <a href="http://llvm.org">LLVM</a> and <a
      href="http://clang.llvm.org/">clang</a>. I've written some <a
      href="clang.html">instructions for installing clang from source</a> on Linux systems.</li>

  <li><a
      href="http://www.openwatcom.org/">Open Watcom</a> only supports C++ 1998, and even that
    support is incomplete, but it does still support various legacy targets such as MS-DOS, 16-bit
    Windows, and OS/2 (as well as modern Windows and Linux).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tutorials</h3>

<ul>
  <li>My <a href="https://github.com/pchapin/tutorialc">C tutorial</a> is useful background
    information.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.learncpp.com/">LearnCpp.Com</a> contains an extensive tutorial on
    C++.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/">C++ tutorial on tutorialspoint</a>. It
    looks fairly polished but only appears to cover C++ 1998.</li>
</ul>

<h3>References</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/">cppreference.com</a> website contains
    reference material for C++. Although not an "official" source of information about the
    language, it nevertheless seems useful and well maintained.</li>

  <li>The <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/">cplusplus.com</a> website also contains
    documentation and unofficial reference material for C++. Let me know which of these two sites
    seems better; perhaps I should only link to one.</li>

  <li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh875057.aspx">Microsoft's reference
    material on C++</a>. Most directly applicable to Visual Studio users, but much of what is
    described is entirely standard.</li>

  <li>The <a href="https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/">C++ Core Guidelines</a> is an
    attempt to describe rules for writing modern, high-quality C++. Some tools (e.g., Visual
    Studio) can check your program against these guidelines and report on violations.</li>

  <li>My <a href="String-Reference-Card.odt"><code>std::string</code> Quick Reference Card</a>
    is a cheat sheet for <code>std::string</code> methods.</li>

  <li>Here is the <a href="C++-Style.odt">C++ Style Guide</a> that I use for my own
    programming, and that I used for the samples in this tutorial.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Libraries</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The official website of <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost</a>. Many people feel boost
    is an essential add-on to any C++ project.</li>
</ul>
